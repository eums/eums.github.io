<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><big>The EUMS Symphony Orchestra is one of the largest and oldest orchestras in Scotland. It is the society's only fully auditioned ensemble, rehearsing every week in term-time from 6.30 to 9.30pm on a Monday evening in the <a title="Rehearsing" href="http:&#47;&#47;eums.eusa.ed.ac.uk&#47;find&#47;practice&#47;">Reid Concert Hall, Bristo Square&lt;&#47;a&gt;.&lt;&#47;big&gt;&lt;&#47;strong&gt;&lt;&#47;p&gt;
<p style="text-align: justify;">Conducted by <a title="Conductors" href="http:&#47;&#47;eums.eusa.ed.ac.uk&#47;society&#47;conductors&#47;">the ever passionate Russell Cowieson&lt;&#47;a&gt;, the orchestra aims to provide students with the opportunity to play large-scale orchestral works to a very high standard. Concerts are given at the end of each semester in various locations around Edinburgh, including Greyfriars Kirk and St Mary's Cathedral. Recent works have included&nbsp;Tchaikovsky's<em>&nbsp;Sixth Symphony&lt;&#47;em&gt;,&nbsp;Rimsky Korzakov's<em> Scheherazade&lt;&#47;em&gt;&nbsp;and&nbsp;Respighi's<em> Pines of Rome&lt;&#47;em&gt;.

<p style="text-align: justify;">Every two years the orchestra teams up with the <a title="Chorus" href="http:&#47;&#47;eums.eusa.ed.ac.uk&#47;society&#47;biography&#47;chorus&#47;">EUMS Chorus&lt;&#47;a&gt; to perform large scale orchestral and choral works in one of its concerts. Recently performed pieces include Orff's<em> Carmina Burana and&lt;&#47;em&gt;&nbsp;Verdi's <em>Requiem&lt;&#47;em&gt; with soloists from within the music society as well as professional singers. Last year Symphony Orchestra teamed up with the Chorus to perform&nbsp;<em>The Dream of Gerontius&lt;&#47;em&gt; by Elgar<em>.&nbsp;&lt;&#47;em&gt;&lt;&#47;p&gt;

<p style="text-align: justify;">As a group of musicians, Symphony Orchestra has a diverse membership and an impressive track record in engaging with our wider community. In 2012 alone the orchestra comprised players from 16 different countries including the&nbsp;Czech Republic,&nbsp;France,&nbsp;the Netherlands, Latvia, Spain, the USA, Hong Kong, Germany and Sweden, and through both our <a title="Education Projects" href="http:&#47;&#47;eums.eusa.ed.ac.uk&#47;community&#47;education&#47;springproject&#47;">extensive education projects&lt;&#47;a&gt; and outreach programmes commits itself to helping communicate the benefits and delights of classical music for everyone. In 2013 this has included a grand rendition of MacMillan's <em>The Confession of Isobel Gowdie&lt;&#47;em&gt; with over 200 children in Dundee's Caird Hall as part of a specially commissioned youth dance performance.&lt;&#47;p&gt;
<p style="text-align: justify;">Auditions for all instruments take place during Fresher's Week and can be signed up for during the Fresher's Fair. The audition involves playing a piece of music selected by yourself and also a short bit of sight-reading in front of a small panel including our conductor.&lt;&#47;p&gt;</p>

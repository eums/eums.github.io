<h1 style="text-align: justify;">Past Conductors - Soon To Be Updated!&lt;&#47;h1&gt;
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Edinburgh University Music Society has had the pleasure of being conducted by a great many well known and talented conductors, alongside supporting many fresh young conductors as they make their way towards greatness. We are privileged&nbsp;to have gained so much support from some of the greatest advocates for music in Scotland and indeed beyond. See a few of them below:&lt;&#47;p&gt;</p>

<h1 style="text-align: left;">Music Library&lt;&#47;h1&gt;<br />
&lt;img alt="" src="http:&#47;&#47;eums.eusa.ed.ac.uk&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;images&#47;w620&#47;library.jpg" width="620" height="250" &#47;&gt;
<p style="text-align: left;">Since our founding in 1867, we have collected a wide range of choral and instrumental music, including pieces written specifically for us by various composers. In 2012 EUMS transferred a large quantity of its collection to a number of other musical organisations on long-term loan; however, we still retain a large library of pieces, some unique.&lt;&#47;p&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Hiring music from our library costs a nominal rate of &pound;10&#47;month per set in addition to postage, with the cost being invoiced at the end of the agreed hire period.&lt;&#47;p&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As part of our aim to increase the ease of provision to younger musicians, <em>student and youth music groups will not incur these hire costs&lt;&#47;em&gt; and would only pay for the postage of music.&lt;&#47;p&gt;
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><big>The full catalogue can be found <a title="Our music catalogue" href="http:&#47;&#47;eums.eusa.ed.ac.uk&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;files&#47;catalogue.pdf">by following this link&lt;&#47;a&gt;.&lt;&#47;big&gt;&lt;&#47;strong&gt;&lt;&#47;p&gt;
<p style="text-align: left;">For further details of the music we have on offer, and to make enquiries with regards to the hire of a set of music, please contact our President at <a title="Email us" href="mailto:president@eums.org.uk" target="_blank">president@eums.org.uk&lt;&#47;a&gt;.&lt;&#47;p&gt;
<p style="text-align: left;"><small>The Edinburgh University Music Society and its committee retains the right to charge appropriate and necessary penalty fees for the damage or loss of any hired music.&lt;&#47;small&gt;&lt;&#47;p&gt;

<h1 style="text-align: justify;">Find Us Performing&lt;&#47;h1&gt;
<p style="text-align: justify;">EUMS have performed at many venues across Scotland and indeed the world to thousands of people from many different backgrounds. We get a great reception wherever we go, and we enjoy playing different venues in different places.&lt;&#47;p&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is only one place that we can call home though: Edinburgh. And it is in Edinburgh where we have been performing since our creation in 1867, in a number of venues across the city.&lt;&#47;p&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In recent years the four venues where we have tended to perform are St. Cuthbert's Church at the end of Princes Street, the Reid Concert Hall on Bristo Square, Greyfriars Kirk just off George IV Bridge and our largest current venue, St. Mary's Cathedral on Palmerston Place. These venues are shown below:&lt;&#47;p&gt;<br />

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>BY TRAIN&lt;&#47;strong&gt;&lt;&#47;h2&gt;
<p style="text-align: justify;">The best way to access St. Cuthbert's Church and St. Mary's Cathedral from outside Edinburgh is by train, getting off at Haymarket station and making your way by foot along Shandwick Place. If you don't fancy trudging through the rain then there is a taxi rank at the station and as these two venues are quite close, it won't cost you too much.&lt;&#47;p&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Access to our other venues by train is also quite straightforward. Getting off at Waverley station and making your way up to the bus stop on Waverley Bridge will allow you to catch either of buses&nbsp;<em>41 or 42 &lt;&#47;em&gt;down George IV Bridge to Greyfriars Kirk or the Reid Concert Hall.&lt;&#47;p&gt;
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>BY BUS&lt;&#47;strong&gt;&lt;&#47;h2&gt;
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you live within Edinburgh, then the bus provides the easiest way to get to our venues. Bus numbers <em>12, 26, 31 and 48&lt;&#47;em&gt; stop on Haymarket Terrace, near Palmerston Place and St. Mary's Cathedral. Bus numbers <em>41 and 42&lt;&#47;em&gt; stop near Greyfriars Kirk and the Reid Concert Hall. For access to St. Cuthbert's Church, buses <em>1, 10, 11, 15, 16, 22, 24, 30 and 34&lt;&#47;em&gt; stop on Lothian Road.&nbsp;For further details of buses around the city, <a title="Lothian Buses" href="http:&#47;&#47;lothianbuses.com&#47;find-your-bus&#47;route-maps.html" target="_blank">go to the Lothian Bus website&lt;&#47;a&gt;.&lt;&#47;p&gt;
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>BY CAR&lt;&#47;strong&gt;&lt;&#47;h2&gt;
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though driving is not the best option for getting around Edinburgh, sometimes it is unavoidable. Access for St. Mary's and St. Cuthbert's is easiest when approaching the city centre from the west. Parking space is at best limited for these venues, and you may have to park some distance away.&lt;&#47;p&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Access to Greyfriars Kirk and the Reid Concert Hall can be made from either the city centre or the south, though the latter is advisable. Following the A701 into the city and turning left and left again onto Buccleuch Street at the Blockbuster will take you up to Bristo Square and beyond up to Greyfriars Kirk. Again, parking is nearly impossible, so you will need to find somewhere to park and walk to the venue.&lt;&#47;p&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is our intention that our chosen venues are easily accessible for all, no matter where you are travelling from. The most important thing is that you enjoy the concert on the night!&lt;&#47;p&gt;</p>

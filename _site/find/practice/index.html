<h1 style="text-align: justify;">Find Us Rehearsing&lt;&#47;h1&gt;
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our two main rehearsal venues are Room G1 in Paterson's Land on Holyrood Road, and the Reid Concert Hall on Bristo Square. Both Sinfonia and the Symphony Orchestra rehearse at the Reid (as it is known), and Chorus rehearse at Paterson's Land.&lt;&#47;p&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For details of buses around the city, <a title="Lothian Buses" href="http:&#47;&#47;lothianbuses.com&#47;find-your-bus&#47;route-maps.html" target="_blank">go to the Lothian Bus website&lt;&#47;a&gt;.&lt;&#47;p&gt;
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, our practice venues are very central in Edinburgh, being near to Pollock Halls and to the other various University of Edinburgh accommodation areas, as well as being in close proximity to Marchmont and Newington. This means that for the vast majority of members, walking and cycling are the best option.&lt;&#47;p&gt;</p>

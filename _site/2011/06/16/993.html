<p>Every member of EUMS loves the thrill and excitement of performing live, and every one of us has at one stage been a youngster looking on at a performance and wanting to know more. Be it through being inspired by watching a concert or learning something new by speaking to one of our performers, the Edinburgh University Music Society provides the perfect environment to enthuse young talent to get involved with classical music. A great way to introduce your children to classical music is to bring them along to one of our concerts. Children are always welcome, and we are more than happy to have a chat with our audience at the interval or after the performance.&nbsp;We are always enthusiastic to speak to interested aspiring musicians, young or old. Who knows? The young musicians of today are undoubtedly the Edinburgh University Music Society of&nbsp;tomorrow.</p>

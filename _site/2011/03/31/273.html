<p>People often wonder what the rules are during a classical concert. When do you clap? What happens if you are late? Should you wear a&nbsp;bow-tie? As it happens there aren&rsquo;t really any rules, and people have just tended to do the same thing since the first music concerts many years ago&hellip; At the Edinburgh University Music Society we want you to come to our concerts and relax, enjoy the music and have a terrific evening, and so we have answered a few of the questions you might be pondering upon about below. If we haven&rsquo;t answered your question here then feel free to get in touch! Is there a dress code? Only for the players! Though an EUMS concert is a good excuse to dress up, we don&rsquo;t mind if you turn up in jeans and trainers either. Can I bring my children? We welcome children to all EUMS concerts, and you can get reduced-price tickets&nbsp;for our concerts&nbsp;for under-16s. What time do the doors open? The majority of EUMS concerts begin at 7.30pm, which means that doors open at around 7pm. Can I buy a ticket on the door? We always sell tickets for our concerts on the door, though&hellip;</p>

<p>Sinfonia is a woodwind, brass and percussion auditioning full symphony orchestra that rehearses in the Reid Concert Hall in Bristo Square every Saturday morning from 10.30 during the&nbsp;University&nbsp;of Edinburgh&rsquo;s term-time. Like the other ensembles of EUMS, Sinfonia puts on a concert at the end of each semester in various venues including the Reid Concert Hall, Greyfriars Kirk and St Mary&rsquo;s Episcopal Cathedral. Despite the string section being non-auditioning the repertoire performed is very challenging but very rewarding for the members. In recent years the ensemble has performed works such as&nbsp;The Carmen Suite by Bizet,&nbsp;Pictures at an Exhibition by Mussorgsky and Dvorak&rsquo;s&nbsp;Symphony No. 8. Sinfonia also collaborates with the Chorus once every two years to perform large choral works. This year Bruckner&rsquo;s&nbsp;Te Deum and Walton&rsquo;s&nbsp;Coronation Te Deum were performed with some stunning solos from within the music society. In previous years repertoire has included&nbsp;The World of the Spirit by Britten and Puccini&rsquo;s&nbsp;Messa de Gloria. The orchestra regularly performs with soloists from within the society giving young, aspiring musicians the opportunity to perform a piece with the backing of a full symphony orchestra. Sinfonia is an open and friendly orchestra with a very active social scene including lunch in the Teviot House&hellip;</p>

<p>The Big Sing is a Come-and-Sing of Handel&rsquo;s <em>Messiah&lt;&#47;em&gt;, which raises money for the Bethany Christian Trust&rsquo;s <em>Stop Homelessness&nbsp;&lt;&#47;em&gt;campaign. The project ran for the first time last year under the baton of award-winning conductor Tom Butler and was an enormous success, raising over &pound;1300 for Bethany, which provided 87 beds for the homeless last winter.

<p>As well as raising money for the charity, the event promotes the fantastic work that Bethany does towards ending homelessness and we believe they deserve the widest possible audience for this cause. It is also an event to get people of all ages enthused about singing; we are particularly keen this year to increase the number of teenage participants.</p>

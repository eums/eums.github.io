<span style="text-align: justify;">Drake Music Scotland believe that&nbsp;disability is no barrier to making music. Since 1997, they have created opportunities for over 6000 children and adults with disabilities to&nbsp;learn to play music independently and to whatever level they aspire.&lt;&#47;span&gt;

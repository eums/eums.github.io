<h6>We are delighted to announce that we have appointed a new conductor for our Sinfonia orchestra! Our beloved Michael Graham will be - literally - passing the baton to the wonderful Peter Keenan come September.&lt;&#47;h6&gt;<br />
Peter read music at the University of York, where he became increasingly in demand as a conductor. Whilst at York, he worked extensively with the university's contemporary music ensemble and was selected as Music Director of the Opera Society. Since graduating he has co-founded a chamber orchestra in the Scottish Borders and worked with various orchestras and ensembles throughout the UK. Peter studies conducting with William Conway and has attended courses with Peter Stark.
<p>We would like to thank Michael Graham for all the excellent work he has done with Sinfonia over the past&nbsp;two years, and wish him the best of luck in his conducting career.</p>

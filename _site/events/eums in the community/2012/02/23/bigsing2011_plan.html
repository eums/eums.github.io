<p>Many of you may remember that the Edinburgh University Music Society partnered with Bethany Christian Trust in October to raise money and awareness for their <em>Stop Homelessness&lt;&#47;em&gt; campaign. The event was a great success, and we received a lot of positive feedback from attendees and audience members. Around 100 singers joined&nbsp;our orchestra and award-winning conductor Tom Butler to sing Handel's <em>Messiah&lt;&#47;em&gt;.

<p>Through entry fees and generous donations we managed to raise a fantastic <strong>&pound;1317.06&lt;&#47;strong&gt;! This money will go towards supporting homeless people and will directly pay for their&nbsp;accommodation and for the framework to ensure that they are able to raise themselves up onto their own feet.

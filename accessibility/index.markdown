# Accessibility

## Venue access

The Edinburgh University Music Society aims to ensure that all of the venues we perform and rehearse in are accessible to all. All of our venues are wheelchair accessible, and we welcome guide dogs at our concerts.

If you have a disability that might prevent you from rehearsing with us, please get in touch, and we will be happy to ensure that any issue is resolved to the best of our ability.

For our concerts, to ensure that we can accommodate you, please let us know of your specific requirements when booking your tickets. Stewards and trained first aid personnel are on duty during any performance to assist you if required. Please [contact us](/contact-us/) for further information about disabled facilities.

The University of Edinburgh's Disability Office provides these maps, detailing access features, gradients and transport links:

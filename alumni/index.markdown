## EUMS Alumni

Our members have always been the most fundamental part of the society. Without them EUMS would simply not exist.

This appreciation is not just limited to our current members. Every event undertaken builds on the experiences of our former members and we value the continued input from our Alumni community.

Let us keep you in the loop regarding news and events with particular relevance to past members by [filling in our alumni signup form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/14OLNbQYGrUgYVInIoPfu3vFC_dRITECSnxVTkwXaqSQ/viewform).

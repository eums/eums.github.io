## EUMS Alumni

### Join our [mailing list][1]

Our members have always been the most fundamental part of the society. Without them EUMS would simply not exist.

This appreciation is not just limited to our current members. Every event undertaken builds on the experiences of our former members and we value the continued input from our Alumni community.

Let us keep you in the loop regarding news and events with particular relevance to past members by [joining our Alumni mailing list][1].

### Join our [Facebook group][2]

We have [a Facebook group][2] for our Alumni, where you can hear about what the society is up to, and get back in touch with people who you attended the society with.

### The Big Reid

The Big Reid is our Alumni newsletter, which updates approximately twice per year. We also archive all issues here:

<ul>
{% for issue in site.data.big_reid_issues %}
<li>
    <a href="{{ site.external_assets }}/docs/big-reid/{{ issue.filename }}">{{ issue.name }}</a>
</li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

To subscribe to the Big Reid, or for any other alumni-related queries, our Alumni Manager will be happy to hear from you, at <alumni@eums.org.uk>.

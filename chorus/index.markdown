## Chorus

The Edinburgh University Music Society Chorus is one of the largest choirs in Scotland, performing several times a year in front of large audiences. It is a non-auditioning SATB symphonic chorus, and we welcome both students and non-students as members. Rehearsals take place every Tuesday from 6.30pm until 8.45pm in Room G1, Paterson’s Land, Holyrood Road during University term-time.  It is conducted by [Neil Metcalfe](/conductors/#neil-metcalfe).

As with the other ensembles of EUMS, Chorus puts on a concert at the end of each semester in various venues including St. Cuthbert’s Church, Greyfriars Kirk and St. Mary’s Episcopal Cathedral. Though the Chorus is non-auditioning, the quality of our performances is very high, and with the numbers behind us we produce a fantastic sound. Don’t take our word for it; [listen to a concert recording of us performing Rossini's *Messe Solennelle*](http://www.last.fm/music/Edinburgh+University+Music+Society/EUMS+Chorus:+Spring+Concert+2010/Rossini:+Petite+Messe+Solennelle,+I.+Kyrie+%28Part+One%29).

Our Chorus performs challenging pieces of music from a wide classical repertoire, with recent works including Bernstein’s *Chichester Psalms*, Jenkins' *The Armed Man* and Verdi's *Messa de Requiem*. Chorus also collaborates with one of our orchestras once a year to perform large choral works, which have recently included Mendelssohn’s Symphony No.2 *Hymn of Praise* and the 2011 sell-out concert Elgar's *Dream of Gerontius*.

Though there is no requirement to read music, it can certainly help; but whether you are a mini-maestro or indeed a hairbrush singer, then there is certainly a place for you.

If you're interested, our Chorus Manager will be happy to hear from you: [chorus@eums.org.uk](mailto:chorus@eums.org.uk).

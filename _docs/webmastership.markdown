Webmastership
=============

## posting

* Consider Tweeting and posting on Facebook for each new post on the website

## maintenance

* Get the following software:
    * GitHub for Windows: http://windows.github.com
    * GitHub account (ask me for access to eums)
    * Ruby http://rubyinstaller.org
    * Ruby DevKit https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/wiki/Development-Kit
    * jekyll (open a cmd window and type "gem install jekyll")

## Large files (audio, images, PDFs)

Large files are easier to handle in Google Drive than GitHub. Put them in the
"website" folder (which I've configured to be accessible to the whole web).
Each Google Drive folder that is publicly accessible has a unique URL. Ours is:

    https://googledrive.com/host/0BxsJMhlYrb4QRTFGSHJTMTRuOEU/

## Adding a newsletter

* Go to `_data/newsletters.yml` and add an entry, just like the other ones. It
  is important to get the syntax exactly right, as this is a machine-readable
  format.
* Create a new post (TODO)
* **Note that** tour newsletters should go only into Google Drive and not on the
  website (because crazy things happen on tour, and we don't want to hurt
  people's reputations or employability, and so on)

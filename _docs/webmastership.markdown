Webmastership
=============

## posting

* Consider Tweeting and posting on Facebook for each new post on the website

## maintenance

* Get the following software:
    * GitHub for Windows: http://windows.github.com
    * GitHub account (ask me for access to eums)
    * Ruby http://rubyinstaller.org
    * Ruby DevKit https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/wiki/Development-Kit
    * jekyll (open a cmd window and type "gem install jekyll")

## Large files (audio, images, PDFs)

Large files are easier to handle in Google Drive than GitHub. Put them in the
"website" folder (which I've configured to be accessible to the whole web).
Each Google Drive folder that is publicly accessible has a unique URL. Ours is:

I had forgotten how much I adore Schubert’s Unfinished Symphony– the clarinet,
oboe, bassoon, French horn and flute principals are very accomplished – it is
such an emotional work and they carried it off well, the conductor once again
bringing out the best from everyone -- The Very Reverend John Mann

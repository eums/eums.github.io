# Setting up your laptop to work with the website

## 1. Install Notepad plus plus

Notepad plus plus (<http://www.notepad-plus-plus.org/>) is a bit like Notepad,
but much better. You will use it to edit posts on the website.

Simply hit the big "download" button on their website and run the installer.

## 2. Install Jekyll, the website software

Jekyll is the software which takes all of the posts and so on, and processes
them to turn them into a website. You will need to install it on your computer
so that you can see how things will look before you publish them.

Go to <http://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com/> and follow the instructions for steps 1 and 2 only.

When it says "Open your favourite command line tool", you can do that by
opening an Explorer window, pressing shift and right clicking, and then
clicking on "Open command window here". Alternatively, if that doesn't work,
press Windows key+R for the Run dialog, and type "cmd".

with Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 (32bits version only)".

Once you've signed up, get someone who is on the EUMS team on github
(<https://github.com/eums>) to add you to it.

service.

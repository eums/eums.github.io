## Community Engagement

The Edinburgh University Music Society has a great time making music, and we
would love for this energy to reach members of the community who might not
otherwise have access to music-making, or to classical music. There is so much
fantastic work already going on, and we encourage this by working to promote a
high standard of music in the community, and by making provisions already on
offer more widely accessible.

Within this vision we have three main avenues of work: **promoting the
work of charities and music-making bodies**; **encouraging interest and
involvement in classical music** through our concert
and tour programmes; and **creating our own hands-on musical
projects** within the community.

For the past few years, EUMS has been expanding the work and projects we do
both within the University and the wider Edinburgh community. In 2010,
following a year of extensive work with schools and communities in the
Edinburgh area, EUMS won the coveted *Edinburgh University Students&rsquo;
Association Community Action Award*. Our projects can be anything from carol
singing at Christmas to our Symphony Orchestra playing at the Caird Hall with
200 school children dancing on stage! We&rsquo;re very much looking forward to
a summer of workshops with the amazing Soweto Choir and performing a series of
concerts in collaboration with Artlink to celebrate the bicentenary of the
Edinburgh Royal Hospital. This year we&rsquo;ll be hosting our annual Education
project on the 23rd October (so get the date in your diaries), Carol
singing at Christmas, Music sessions with Artlink and Drake Music, a day of
master classes with members from the Scottish Chamber Orchestra and our Big
Sing day in Second semester, among lots of other bits and bobs!

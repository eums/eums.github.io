<p>The Edinburgh University Music Society has a great time making music, and we would love for this energy to reach members of the community who might not otherwise have access to music-making, or to classical music. There is so much fantastic work already going on, and we encourage this by working to promote a high standard of music in the community, and by making provisions already on offer more widely accessible.<&#47;p></p>
<p>Within this vision we have three main avenues of work: <strong>promoting the work of charities and music-making bodies<&#47;strong>; <strong>encouraging interest and involvement in classical music<&#47;strong> through our concert and tour programmes; and <strong>creating our own hands-on musical projects<&#47;strong> within the community.<&#47;p></p>
<p>For the past few years, EUMS has been expanding the work and projects we do both within the University and the wider Edinburgh&nbsp;community. In 2010, following a year of extensive work with schools and communities in the Edinburgh area, EUMS won the coveted&nbsp;<em>Edinburgh University Students&rsquo; Association Community Action Award<&#47;em>.&nbsp; Our projects can be anything from carol singing at Christmas to our Symphony Orchestra playing at the Caird Hall with 200 school children dancing on stage!! We&rsquo;re very much looking forward to a summer of workshops with the amazing Soweto Choir and performing a series of concerts in collaboration with Artlink to celebrate the bicentenary of the Edinburgh Royal Hospital. &nbsp;This year we&rsquo;ll be hosting our annual Education project on the 23rd&nbsp;October (so get the date in your diaries) , Carol singing at Christmas , Music sessions with Artlink and Drake Music , a day of master classes with members from the Scottish Chamber Orchestra and our Big Sing day in Second semester , among lots of other bits and bobs !<&#47;p></p>

<h2><span style="text-align: justify;">Drake Music Scotland<&#47;span><&#47;h2><br />
<span style="text-align: justify;">Drake Music Scotland believe that&nbsp;disability is no barrier to making music. Since 1997, they have created opportunities for over 6000 children and adults with disabilities to&nbsp;learn to play music independently and to whatever level they aspire.<&#47;span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Using both conventional instruments and innovative technologies, Drake deliver a range of education and training projects in a variety of settings across Scotland including special and mainstream schools, communities and our fully equipped and accessible rehearsal and recording studio in Edinburgh.<&#47;p></p>

## Contact us

There are a number of ways that you can get in contact with the society:

### In person

You can speak to any one of our dedicated ensemble managers in person by coming along to their respective rehearsals. Details of the rehearsal times and locations can be found on our ensemble pages:

* [Chorus](/chorus/)
* [Sinfonia](/sinfonia/)
* [Symphony Orchestra](/symphony-orchestra/)

### By email

The quickest way to get a response from us if you cannot come and speak to us in person is by emailing us at [secretary@eums.org.uk](mailto:secretary@eums.org.uk).

You can also contact one of our ensemble managers directly:

* Chorus: <chorus@eums.org.uk>
* Sinfonia: <sinfonia@eums.org.uk>
* Symphony Orchestra: <symphony@eums.org.uk>

### In writing

If you are in no rush and fancy having a good scrawl, or indeed feel that what you wish to say is conveyed best in the form of written word, then our address is as follows:

<address>
Edinburgh University Music Society<br>
The University of Edinburgh<br>
Alison House<br>
12 Nicolson Square<br>
Edinburgh<br>
EH8 9DF
</address>

### By phone

Though it is not possible to provide a universal society phone number, by contacting EUMS as detailed above, an appropriate phone number for one of our committee members can be administered on a need-to-know basis.

### Music library

EUMS retains a large quantity of music which is available for hire. For further details, please contact our President at <president@eums.org.uk> or see our [music library page](/music-library/).

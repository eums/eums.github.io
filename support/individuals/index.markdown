<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">DONATE NOW<&#47;span><&#47;h3></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Individual donations, whatever the size, are essential to the Society and contribute significantly to securing the future of the Edinburgh University Music Society. Your support will help the Society to sustain its mission and will ensure that our innovative education and community programme continues to grow.<&#47;p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whether you have enjoyed one of our Edinburgh concerts, know someone who has taken part in an education project run by us or just sat enjoying mulled wine at one of our various Christmas carolling performances, we hope you will consider making a donation to the EUMS.<&#47;p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Please help us to continue our work by making a single donation today, or <a title="EUMS Gold membership" href="http:&#47;&#47;eums.eusa.ed.ac.uk&#47;support&#47;gold&#47;">by signing up to become an EUMS Gold member<&#47;a>.<&#47;p><br />

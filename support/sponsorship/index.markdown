<h1 style="text-align: justify;">Corporate Support<&#47;h1></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Our Strengths<&#47;h4></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <em>Edinburgh University Music Society<&#47;em> is Scotland's foremost student music organisation with a reputation for outstanding music-making, energy and innovation.&nbsp;We are proud to have an ever-expanding position within the musical culture of Scotland, having become the first Scottish university music society in 1867.<&#47;p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since 2010 the EUMS brand has expanded to incorporate a widely recognisable online presence and has become highly successful in broadcasting our aims and events to a far-ranging&nbsp;audience.<&#47;p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The society performs ten or more times a year, in locations across Edinburgh, the UK and indeed the world. Our brand is seen by thousands of people throughout the year, bringing the community into contact with a wide array of publicity material. Our Spring, Summer and Winter Concert Series are&nbsp;a well-known feature of the Edinburgh musical calendar.<&#47;p></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-align: justify;">Put simply, sponsorship of our society inspires current and potential customers to invest in your brand.<&#47;span><&#47;strong><&#47;p></p>

<&#47;ul></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Edinburgh University Music Society offers two sponsorship options. This means that we can tailor our benefits to your input, and allows us to work together to get the best out of our partnership.<&#47;p></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Event Sponsorship<&#47;h2></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our society offers a unique marketing advantage in that we allow exposure to a very wide demographic. From the children involved in our eduction projects and the student body that make up the majority of the society through to the range of ages that attend our concerts: we provide a very effective way to ensure that your corporate devices are seen by many.<&#47;p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Events we undertake include our <strong>concerts<&#47;strong>, <strong>education projects<&#47;strong>, <strong>international tours<&#47;strong>, <strong>charity fundraising events<&#47;strong> and <strong>social functions<&#47;strong>. All of these offer different&nbsp;opportunities&nbsp;to allow you to align your input with the maximum marketing output to a target audience suited to your product.<&#47;p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In exchange for meeting some or all of the costs of an event or events you will be given access to a range of benefits including:<&#47;p></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Visibility and branding<&#47;strong> on programmes, posters, flyers, our website and the&nbsp;opportunity&nbsp;to set up an exhibition stall at the event(s).<&#47;em><&#47;li>

<&#47;ul><br />
<&#47;ul></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We can also provide chamber musicians for any corporate events that you hold within the period of your support, giving you the edge over your competitors.<&#47;p></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Asset Sponsorship<&#47;h2></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The society often requires equipment, resources and facilities that can be both costly and difficult to obtain. By providing these at reduced costs you will be exposing our members and our audiences to your brand, and will also be ensuring that we can continue to complete <a title="Our Mission" href="http:&#47;&#47;eums.eusa.ed.ac.uk&#47;society&#47;organisation&#47;">our mission<&#47;a> to the best of our ability.<&#47;p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Asset sponsors are also entitled to the benefits detailed above and we will tailor these according to the scale of your input.<&#47;p></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Advertising<&#47;h2></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Be it on our website or in concert programmes, advertising with the society lets you tap into a wide demographic, whilst also allowing you to be confident about the people who engage with your brand.<&#47;p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From individual concerts to an entire Season, the EUMS can put together a flexible advertising package to suit your needs and your budget.

<h1>Support Us</h1></p>
<p>The EUMS is Scotland&rsquo;s foremost student music body, giving six concerts a year within Edinburgh alongside an extensive range of additional performing events. The society also delivers a pioneering education and community programme, and has worked closely with several local charities.</p></p>
<p>Every year the society expands its projects and concerts to give its members and the wider community a better experience, and to align with our society mission. We are run entirely by students who volunteer time out of their degrees through a passion for involvement and inclusion in music.</p></p>
<p>In our 2011/12 season the society spent just under <strong>&pound;40,000</strong> on our events and projects, and this figure builds year on year.</p></p>
<p>As we gain more support we are able to expand our horizons further, putting on bigger and better concerts and reaching more and more primary and secondary school pupils.

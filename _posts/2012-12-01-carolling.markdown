Alas, the end of term has arrived, and for many of us this means heading home and getting a good week or two of rest.

For others though, this means that it is carolling time!

The dates we have for carolling this year are:

* **SATURDAY 1st DECEMBER** &mdash; Foodies Christmas festival at the Edinburgh International Conference Centre, Morrison St. This is a ticketed event with lots of food and whisky samples... Meet at 11.15am.
* **MONDAY 3rd DECEMBER** - EUMS Christmas party! 6.30pm at the Reid Concert Hall... <a title="Facebook event here..." href="https://www.facebook.com/events/452787524778539/" target="_blank">Find the Facebook event here</a>.
* **TUESDAY 4th DECEMBER** - Switching on the lights at the Southside Community Centre on Nicolson Street at 5.50pm. Mulled wine action included!
* **THURSDAY 6th DECEMBER** - 7pm for carols at the Pear Tree and Counting House, an old favourite for a brisk evening!
* **THURSDAY 13th DECEMBER** - Carolling at Stockbridge House, Cheyne Street for LifeCare (Edinburgh) Ltd.
* **SUNDAY 16th DECEMBER** - Princes Street Mall at 11.30am. Hop along before you do your holiday shopping!

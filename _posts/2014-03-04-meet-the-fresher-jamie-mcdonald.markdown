<p><strong>Instrument:<&#47;strong> Trombone</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tell us a little bit about your musical background before you came to&nbsp;Edinburgh?<&#47;strong></p>
<p>When I lived in the UK still, when I was about 11, I played in school orchestras and&nbsp;concert bands. Nothing that fancy really, that was my taster for it all! Then I moved to&nbsp;Finland and started playing in a wind orchestra, that&rsquo;s where I stuck but I had a little&nbsp;dabble in a university orchestra when I was 16, and everyone else was 25! <strong>[EUMS&nbsp;wonder if they are as sociable as us!]<&#47;strong> I played piano for a long time before trombone&nbsp;though too!</p>
<p><strong>What have been you most memorable moment of your EUMS membership so&nbsp;far?<&#47;strong></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a tough one but it will have to be sectional meals with Das Mute, when I had&nbsp;to drink a whole trombone mute of beer in one. So what we all want to know is, did&nbsp;you succeed? Almost, almost! I will succeed next year, I promise you all. <strong>[EUMS is&nbsp;going to hold him to that one]<&#47;strong></p>
<p><strong>You are president Vicky&rsquo;s chosen fresher. How does this feel?<&#47;strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite scary in some respects actually. She likes to have a lot of power over me and&nbsp;I&rsquo;m trying hard to kind of distance myself from her. But otherwise it has been fun,&nbsp;there have been benefits<strong> [I wonder what these benefits are? President Vicky has kept&nbsp;them VERY quiet]<&#47;strong> and how are you living up to the task? I suppose you&rsquo;ll have to&nbsp;ask her that, I can&rsquo;t be telling...</p>
<p><strong>You are a committed member of our hockey team, what&rsquo;s the biggest kept secret&nbsp;on the Peffermill pitch on a cold Friday night?<&#47;strong></p>
<p>Ummm, I think it&rsquo;s ummmm, ehhh. It&rsquo;s not really a secret anymore but Kevin Hanley&nbsp;is our biggest secret with his one handed skills. I think it&rsquo;s basically how we are going&nbsp;to win all the rest of our games this year.</p>
<p><strong>Who did you have your eyes on at the EUMS Ball? Those dance moves must&nbsp;have won you some attention?<&#47;strong></p>
<p>I was asked to go with several people. Sadly I had to disappoint a lot of them. There&nbsp;is nobody really just now.<strong> [EUMS GIRLS, Get in there quick before he is snapped&nbsp;up]<&#47;strong></p>
<p><strong>If you could play another instrument what would it be?<&#47;strong></p>
<p>If it was orchestral it would be the trumpet anything else it would be tenor sax.&nbsp;Patrick said trumpet in our last interview as well, what&rsquo;s so special about the&nbsp;trumpet? I think it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve been playing trombone which is nice, but the&nbsp;trumpet has all the interesting parts and bits that everyone can hear. It would be&nbsp;nice to be heard a bit more.<strong> [Don&rsquo;t cry Jamie...I think he&rsquo;s feeling a bit bitter &ndash;&nbsp;Trombone concerto for next Sinfonia concert?]<&#47;strong></p>
<p><strong>What has been your best Sinfonia moment so far?<&#47;strong></p>
<p>Playing Finlandia by Sibelius in the first concert I played in because it reminded me&nbsp;of home and went very well! <strong>[Tears are most definitely now falling! It&rsquo;s all too&nbsp;emotional. Someone pass me the tissues.]<&#47;strong></p>
<p><strong>You are playing some interesting repertoire this semester with Sinfonia. Where&nbsp;and when is the concert and most importantly what are you playing?<&#47;strong></p>
<p>Ehhh, it&rsquo;s in March sometime<strong> [Correct]<&#47;strong>. I have no idea when. Where? I presume it&rsquo;s&nbsp;here in the Reid <strong>[Correct! Nearly there Jamie].<&#47;strong>What? Something by Wagner which&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know the name of... Schumann 4 and the Beethoven but I&rsquo;m not playing in&nbsp;that. <strong>[At last, we got there &ndash; well just about!]<&#47;strong></p>
<p><strong>Any final words for EUMS?<&#47;strong></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really think so. I&rsquo;ll think of something later.<strong> [We are still waiting]<&#47;strong></p>

**Tell us a little bit about your musical background before you came to Edinburgh?**

When I lived in the UK still, when I was about 11, I played in school
orchestras and concert bands. Nothing that fancy really, that was my
taster for it all! Then I moved to Finland and started playing in a wind
orchestra, that&rsquo;s where I stuck but I had a little dabble in a
university orchestra when I was 16, and everyone else was 25!
**[EUMS wonder if they are as sociable as us!]** I played
piano for a long time before trombone though too!

**What has been your most memorable moment of your EUMS membership so
far?**

That&rsquo;s a tough one but it will have to be sectional meals with Das Mute, when I had to drink a whole trombone mute of beer in one.

**So what we all want to know is, did you succeed?**

Almost, almost! I will succeed next year, I promise you all. **[EUMS is going to hold him to that one]**

**You are president Vicky&rsquo;s chosen fresher. How does this feel?**

It&rsquo;s quite scary in some respects actually. She likes to have a lot of power over me and I&rsquo;m trying hard to kind of distance myself from her. But otherwise it has been fun, there have been benefits **[I wonder what these benefits are? President Vicky has kept them VERY quiet]** and how are you living up to the task? I suppose you&rsquo;ll have to ask her that, I can&rsquo;t be telling&hellip;

**You are a committed member of our hockey team, what&rsquo;s the biggest kept secret on the Peffermill pitch on a cold Friday night?**

Ummm, I think it&rsquo;s ummmm, ehhh. It&rsquo;s not really a secret anymore but Kevin Hanley is our biggest secret with his one handed skills. I think it&rsquo;s basically how we are going to win all the rest of our games this year.

**Who did you have your eyes on at the EUMS Ball? Those dance moves must have won you some attention?**

I was asked to go with several people. Sadly I had to disappoint a lot of them. There is nobody really just now. **[EUMS GIRLS, get in there quick before he is snapped up]**

**If you could play another instrument what would it be?**

If it was orchestral it would be the trumpet, anything else it would be tenor sax. Patrick said trumpet in our last interview as well, what&rsquo;s so special about the trumpet? I think it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve been playing trombone which is nice, but the trumpet has all the interesting parts and bits that everyone can hear. It would be nice to be heard a bit more. **[Don&rsquo;t cry Jamie&hellip;I think he&rsquo;s feeling a bit bitter&mdash;Trombone concerto for next Sinfonia concert?]**

**What has been your best Sinfonia moment so far?**

Playing Finlandia by Sibelius in the first concert I played in because it reminded me of home and went very well! **[Tears are most definitely now falling! It&rsquo;s all too emotional. Someone pass me the tissues.]**

**You are playing some interesting repertoire this semester with Sinfonia. Where and when is the concert and most importantly what are you playing?**

Ehhh, it&rsquo;s in March sometime **[Correct]**. I have no idea when. Where? I presume it&rsquo;s here in the Reid **[Correct! Nearly there Jamie]**. What? Something by Wagner which I don&rsquo;t know the name of... Schumann 4 and the Beethoven but I&rsquo;m not playing in that. **[At last, we got there&mdash;well just about!]**

**Any final words for EUMS?**

I don&rsquo;t really think so. I&rsquo;ll think of something later. **[We are still waiting]**

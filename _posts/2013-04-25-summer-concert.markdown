The Edinburgh University Music Society's 3 wonderful ensembles - Symphony Orchestra, Chorus and Sinfonia - will be joining forces to perform an exciting programme of music featuring works by Dvorak, Haydn and Holst, and will be conducted by Russell Cowieson, Neil Metcalfe and Michael Graham.

Doors open at 7pm, and it is recommended that you arrive early to ensure that you are not disappointed!

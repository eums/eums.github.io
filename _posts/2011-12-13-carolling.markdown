<p>Alas, the end of term has arrived, and for many of us this means heading home and getting a good week or two of rest.<&#47;p></p>
<p>For others though, this means that it is carolling time!<&#47;p></p>
<p>The dates we have for carolling this year are:<&#47;p></p>
<h4><strong>TUESDAY 6th DECEMBER<&#47;strong>- <em>St Patrick's Square, the turning on of the lights, with our very own brass ensemble. 6pm.<&#47;em><&#47;h4></p>
<h4><strong>TUESDAY 13th DECEMBER<&#47;strong> - <em>The Pear Tree at 6pm.<&#47;em><&#47;h4></p>
<h4><strong>FRIDAY 16th DECEMBER<&#47;strong> - <em>Meadows Carols for St Catharine's Homeless Project at 4pm. Meet on the Compass on the bottom of Middle Meadow Way, with an empty jam jar and tea-light. <a title="Facebook event here" href="https:&#47;&#47;www.facebook.com&#47;events&#47;115983018514608&#47;" target="_blank">Facebook event here<&#47;a>.<&#47;em><&#47;h4></p>

Alas, the end of term has arrived, and for many of us this means heading home and getting a good week or two of rest.

For others though, this means that it is carolling time!

The dates we have for carolling this year are:

* <strong>TUESDAY 6th DECEMBER</strong>- <em>St Patrick's Square, the turning on of the lights, with our very own brass ensemble. 6pm.</em>
* <strong>TUESDAY 13th DECEMBER</strong> - <em>The Pear Tree at 6pm.</em>
* <strong>FRIDAY 16th DECEMBER</strong> - <em>Meadows Carols for St Catharine's Homeless Project at 4pm. Meet on the Compass on the bottom of Middle Meadow Way, with an empty jam jar and tea-light. <a title="Facebook event here" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/115983018514608/" target="_blank">Facebook event here</a>.</em>
* <strong>SUNDAY 18th DECEMBER</strong> - <em>Princes Street (on junction with Frederick Street called "Busker East") at 6pm.</em>

For those of you with ongoing exams, best of luck, and for all Musocers: see you next semester!

Whether you are in Edinburgh or not, the Edinburgh University Music Society wishes you a very Merry Christmas!

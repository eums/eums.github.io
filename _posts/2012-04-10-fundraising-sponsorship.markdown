At this year's AGM the society created a new post within the 2012 committee:
the **Fundraising and Sponsorship Manager**. This year the role is being filled
by Michael Sawaryn, a friendly member of Symphony Orchestra known for his
mother's highly sought after and delicious charity brownies.

Last year the society put on multiple concerts in a variety of venues,
organised a highly successful charity event in the form of the Big Sing and
engaged with over 400 primary school pupils in our annual Spring Education
Project. This was completed exlusively from the subscription fees of our own
performing members and [Gold members](/support-us/individual/).

In order to ensure that we are performing in the best available venues and are
able to attain the most exciting and high quality music, we often need to take
part in additional fundraising activities. These have usually existed as bake
sales around the university campus or during the intervals of our concerts and
are vital in allowing us to fund bigger and better concerts.

It is often difficult for busy committee members to run such fundraising
efforts on their own. Also, in order to expand our scope and to allow us to
better fulfil [our mission](/about-us/), we always seek to attain
additional corporate sponsorship. In order to take control of this, and to
manage our incoming finances alongside our Treasurer the Fundraising and
Sponsorship Manager will seek to gain the support of local and national
businesses who wish to align themselves with positive action in the wider
community.

If you have any queries regarding how the society makes or spends its money, or wish to discuss opportunities surrounding sponsorship, please contact Michael at [fundraising@eums.org.uk](mailto:fundraising@eums.org.uk).

<p>The Edinburgh Charity Orchestra is a new group that has been set up to perform large scale concerts in order to raise money for and awareness about the work of local charities. The orchestra is invitation only and draws from some of the best student and amateur talent in Edinburgh (including many of our own players), as well as looking to give young professionals experience as composers, soloists and conductors. The group's conductor, Iain McLarty, is a well known figure within society circles, and was once conductor of our very own Sinfonia.<&#47;p></p>
<p>Edinburgh Charity Orchestra's inaugural concert will feature Mahler's epic first symphony alongside the ever popular second piano concerto by Rachmaninov and three short pieces by local composer Jake Spence. Come along for a night of fantastic music and help raise money for a great cause with profits going to The Yard.<&#47;p></p>
<p>The profits from this concert will be going to The Yard. This is the only purpose built indoor and outdoor adventure play facility for disabled children in Scotland. It is run by a team of specialist play workers who inspire, guide and support the children who visit. The Yard&rsquo;s unique community environment offers fun and friendship and encourages children to explore, be challenged and be themselves. <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.theyardscotland.org.uk&#47;">You can find out more about it here<&#47;a>.<&#47;p></p>

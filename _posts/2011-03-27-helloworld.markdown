Well, following a year of speculation and a day or so of hard graft, the 2011 facelifted EUMS website is up and running, if still in its infancy&hellip;

The new website provides access to more details about the society and what we do, and also provides further details for the events we do outside of the concert season.

It has been created for you, the browser, and so if you have any feedback at all, please do not hesitate to [contact our Publicity Manager](mailto:publicity@eums.org.uk).

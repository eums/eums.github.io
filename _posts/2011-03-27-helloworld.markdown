<p>Well, following a year of speculation and a day or so of hard graft, the 2011 facelifted EUMS website is up and running, if still in its infancy...</p>
<p>The new website provides access to more details about the society and what we do, and also provides further details for the events we do outside of the concert season.</p>
<p>It has been created for you, the browser, and so if you have any feedback at all, do not hesitate to contact our Publicity Manager <a title="Email our Publicity Manager" href="mailto:publicity@eums.org.uk" target="_blank">here<&#47;a>.</p>

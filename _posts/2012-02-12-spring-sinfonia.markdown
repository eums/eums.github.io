Sinfonia are bringing us a packed programme this Spring, combining a first half of renowned French pieces and a second half of British classics.

Not only are they performing Macunn's archetypal Scottish overture <em>Land of the Mountain and the Flood</em> and Elgar's <em>Pomp and Circumstance Military Marches 1,3 and 4</em> and <em>Enigma Variation No. 9 (Nimrod)</em>, but Berlioz's <em>Beatrice and Benedict Overture</em> is sure to delight.

To top off this mighty programme Sinfonia will be joined by cellist Daniel Kraemer for Saint-Sa&euml;ns' stunning <em>Cello Concerto No. 1</em>, rounding off a concert that is not to be missed!

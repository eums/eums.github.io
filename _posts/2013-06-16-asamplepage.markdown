<h2><strong>Singing Together</strong><br />
<strong>Friday 21st June 7pm</strong><br />
<strong>at the Talbot Rice Gallery</strong></h2><br />
 </p>
<p>The Royal Edinburgh Hospital singing group the Heart and Soul<br />
Singsters join forces with the Edinburgh University Music Society<br />
chorus for a massed sing in the Georgian Gallery.</p>
<p>Part of the Ever Present Past programme celebrating 200 years of the<br />
hospital, the massed sing will be a fun event to experiment with the<br />
acoustics of the gallery and for people to experience singing as part<br />
of a big group.</p>
<p>There will be an open rehearsal from 5.30 - 6.30pm to practice the<br />
songs with song leader Penny Stone, which anyone is welcome to join.</p>
<p>People are encouraged to wear something red to make a visual impact.<br />
If you can't make the rehearsal everyone attending the public<br />
performance will be welcome to sing or hum along.</p>

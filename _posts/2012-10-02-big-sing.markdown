<p class="hero">
For the second year running, the Edinburgh University Music Society and Bethany
Christian Trust are teaming up to bring you The Big Sing 2012.
</p>

<p class="hero">
Saturday 3rd November 2012<br>
St Cuthbert's Parish Church
</p>

<p class="hero">
Come along and sing Handel's Messiah under the baton of legendary past EUMS
conductor Nick Fletcher whilst supporting Bethany's acclaimed 'Stop
Homelessness' campaign.
</p>

### The event

The event will involve rehearsals throughout the day (with tea and coffee being
provided) and a concert in the evening, where performers and audience members
will be able to bid for the chance to conduct the *Hallelujah Chorus* in all of
its glory. Music will be available to hire for &pound;2 per copy.

Invite all of your friends and family to come and see the concert in the
evening... We will also make a collection at the end of the evening, and any
donations will be more than welcome. All proceeds will be given to Bethany
Christian Trust to support their Stop Homelessness campaign.

Concert dress for the day will be **brightly coloured shirts and blouses!**

### On the day

Rehearsals will run all day with the concert taking place in the evening. Doors
will open at 9.30 with Nick starting rehearsals at 10am. There will be a bake
sale during the day and at the interval in the evening.

*Bethany's mission is to relieve the suffering and meet the long
term needs of homeless and vulnerable people. Every year Bethany helps over
4,000 people to find, equip and maintain a home, overcome addictions and tackle
other social and educational barriers which prevent them from living a full and
healthy life.*

*Bethany offers shelter and so much more besides, working with people to
address the root causes of homelessness so they can move on into independent
living. Bethany gives homeless and vulnerable people hope and a future. Watch

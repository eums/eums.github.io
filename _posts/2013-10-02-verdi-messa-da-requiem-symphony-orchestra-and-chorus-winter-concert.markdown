<p>Edinburgh University Music Society's Symphony Orchestra and Chorus join forces under the baton of Russell Cowieson to create an epic performance of Verdi's Messa da Requiem. In the stunning setting of the McEwan Hall, it promises to be a spectacular evening!</p>
<p>Tickets are available in rehearsals and also online at Ticket Source;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ticketsource.co.uk/date/76808">http://www.ticketsource.co.uk/date/76808</a></p>
<p>We recommend buying tickets beforehand as availability on the door may be limited.</p>
<p>The concert itself will begin at 19.30, but the performance will be preceded by an exciting and informative talk [speaker tbc] in connection with the work. This will be in the McEwan Hall at 6.45 and is free of charge.</p>

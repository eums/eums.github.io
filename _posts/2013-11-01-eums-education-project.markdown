"Last Wednesday - 60 musicians, 150 school children, and our conductor, Michael
Devlin, assembled for the EUMS annual Education Project. For this project, we
aim to introduce school children to the world and sounds of the orchestra and
choir. We had Beyonc&eacute;, Olly Murs and even Avicii songs arranged for
orchestra by some of our very own members and alumni - special thanks to Tim
Cais, Vicky Carmichael, Olivia Goodman and Sam Williams for these. And at the
front, leading each workshop was myself rather nervously wondering if
everything would go to plan and the sessions would be fun for everyone
involved. As it turned out, I worried needlessly as you really can't go too
wrong allowing the children to hit a bass drum as loud as they can and conduct
an entire orchestra as fast or as slowly as they wanted! We listened to the
instruments individually and spoke about how each one was made, its place in
the orchestra and what sort of sounds it can make - this brought a lot of
laughter when the trombone was demonstrating a glissando! It was great to see
both the musicians and children enjoying making music together and will
hopefully have encouraged musicians of the future. Thank you to all members who
took part and thank you to the children who got involved so enthusiastically!"

"I had a great time at the education project! It was really nice to play
something else other than classical music again, and the reactions from the
children when they heard what we were going to play were just fantastic! Its
really good to see kids interested in music, and especially the
trombone&hellip; Who doesn't want to hear glissandos?! Hope to maybe see some
of them playing in the orchestra in years to come&hellip;?"

"I really enjoyed playing in this year's education project. I loved playing the
fun orchestral arrangement of songs the kids would know, and it was really
great to see them sing along and have a really fun time too. The kids loved
getting involved by trying out all the different percussion instruments, and
having a go at conducting. This was a fun filled day which has hopefully
inspired the future generation of musicians to get involved with music."

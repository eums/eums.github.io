The Edinburgh Charity Orchestra was set up in 2010 to perform large scale
concerts in order to raise money for and awareness about the work of local
charities. The orchestra is invitation only and draws from some of the best
student and amateur talent in Edinburgh (including many of our own players), as
well as looking to give young professionals experience as composers, soloists
and conductors. The group's founder, Iain McLarty, is a well known figure
within society circles, and was once conductor of our very own Sinfonia.

The profits from this concert will be going to Music in Hospitals. Their aim
is to enhance the lives of people of all ages in hospital or long term care
across Scotland through the provision of live music. Last year 4238 concerts
were provided nationally, with 1620 of these taking place in Scotland. [Find

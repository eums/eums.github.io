<p>The Edinburgh Charity Orchestra was set up in 2010 to perform large scale concerts in order to raise money for and awareness about the work of local charities. The orchestra is invitation only and draws from some of the best student and amateur talent in Edinburgh (including many of our own players), as well as looking to give young professionals experience as composers, soloists and conductors. The group's founder, Iain McLarty, is a well known figure within society circles, and was once conductor of our very own Sinfonia.<&#47;p></p>
<p>The profits from this concert will be going to Music in Hospitals. Their aim is to enhance the lives of people of all ages in hospital or long term care across Scotland through the provision of live music.&nbsp;Last year 4238 concerts were provided nationally, with 1620 of these taking place in Scotland. <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.musicinhospitalsscotland.org.uk&#47;">You can find out more about the charity here<&#47;a>.<&#47;p></p>

This November it is the turn of the Symphony Orchestra to join forces with our Chorus and we are bringing you an incredible performance: Elgar's epic <em>Dream of Gerontius</em>.

With a chorus of 180 alongside the grandeur of Symphony Orchestra this will be a concert not to miss. Doors open at 7pm, and it is recommended that you arrive early to ensure that you are not disappointed!

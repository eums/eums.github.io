<h6 style="text-align: justify;">Our first concert of the academic year falls on the 30th of November; St. Andrew's Day in Scotland. So what better way to celebrate our national Saint than to come along to St. Cuthbert's Parish Church to hear music from the Auld Alliance?<&#47;h6></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our repertoire for the evening includes one of Poulenc's most celebrated works. His&nbsp;<em>Gloria&nbsp;<&#47;em>is a setting of the Roman Catholic Gloria in Excelsis Deo and includes a fine soprano solo by Amy Strachan, a third year music student at the University of Edinburgh. Joining our French&nbsp;line-up&nbsp;will be Faure's&nbsp;<em>Cantique de Jean Racine&nbsp;<&#47;em>which was written when the composer was only nineteen years old.<&#47;p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Returning to home soil, we sing John Gardner's&nbsp;<em>A Burns Sequence<&#47;em>&nbsp;which was first performed&nbsp;by the British Federation of Youth Choirs and the&nbsp;Scottish Chamber Orchestra in Glasgow in 1995, conducted by ex-EUMS member and conductor Christopher Bell.<&#47;p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This sequence sets out some of the varied activities of Burns' life. His religious&nbsp;convictions, his love of setting new words to traditional melodies, his delight in&nbsp;romantic love (and philandering), and his use of English as well as the Lallans are all&nbsp;included, showing Burns - the highly cultured man who did not forget his lowly origin.<&#47;p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We will also sing Ken Johnston's&nbsp;<em>Now is the Time of Peace.&nbsp;<&#47;em>This moving work was written as a commemorative for Scotland's Holocaust Memorial Day. The text is a plea for hope and peace, and that all fear be past.<&#47;p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What better way to end the long month of November than by coming along to the EUMS Chorus' Winter Concert? We hope to see you all there...<&#47;p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Doors open at 7pm, and it is recommended that you arrive early to ensure that you are not disappointed!<&#47;p></p>

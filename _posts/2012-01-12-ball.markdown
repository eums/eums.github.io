The New Year brings delights in all forms, but for most the highlight of the social calendar is the Edinburgh University Music Society Ball... This year being held on the <strong>9th February</strong>.

For those of you who missed the Freshers' Week ceilidh and indeed for those of you who didn't, come along and enjoy fine dining and fantastic dancing in Teviot Row House. We will be booking out the whole of the top floor of Teviot (the Loft Bar and Debating Hall are up here) for the evening's frivolities.

As usual, the evening will start at 7pm with drinks in the Loft Bar followed by a delicious three course dinner in the Debating Hall. After dinner, the debating hall will be transformed into a ball room where we can dance the night away with the Edinburgh University Music Society's favourite live ceilidh band. If that wasn't all enough the disco lights will descend before midnight and we can party on into the early hours to the latest disco tunes...

The cost of a ticket is <strong>£25</strong>, and these will be available from the first rehearsals onwards. Please buy tickets early so as not to be disappointed!

If for some reason you are unable to attend the dinner (our condolences) then you can purchase a "ceilidh only" ticket for the rosy sum of only <strong>&pound;5</strong>.

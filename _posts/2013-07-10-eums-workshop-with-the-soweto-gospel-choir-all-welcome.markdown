This week we are extremely excited to be taking part in two workshops with the Soweto Melodic Voices, who are in Edinburgh for a month performing at the Fringe. The workshops will be taking place at **St. John's Church**, at the Lothian Road end of Princes Street, on **Tuesday 6th** and **Friday 9th August**, from **10.30am - 11.30am**.

Our workshops will be a sharing of musical styles &mdash; we'll learn some African/gospel songs and we'll teach them a few scots songs. Auld lang syne will definitely be one we'll be teaching so please brush up on the words!

Anyone and everyone is welcome along to these workshops - members of Music Society, family, friends, and anybody interested! Please arrive at 10.20am to be ready to start at 10.30am.

Everyone who attends the workshops is also invited to a reception with the principal and vice principal to welcome Soweto to Edinburgh. We'll be performing at this hopefully as well as enjoying the food and wine. This is on the 14<sup>th</sup> from 6-7pm in Old College - more information on Tuesday. Please contact Julie Aitken, our Community Outreach Manager, with any questions at community@eums.org.uk.

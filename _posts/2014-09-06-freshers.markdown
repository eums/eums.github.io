Whether you’re a new or returning student, now is the best time to get involved with EUMS! Here’s what we have on for Freshers’ Week:

### Bake Sale

**Monday 8th, Tuesday 9th<br>
11.00am – 3.00pm @ Bristo Square**

Come and find our stall to hear about why you should join the society, sign up for auditions, and buy a slice or two of lovely cake.

### Societies Fair

**Wednesday 10th, Thursday 11th<br>
10.00am – 4.00pm @ Pleasance**

If you want to hear about joining the society or signing up for auditions, you can also come and find us in the Pleasance during the Societies Fair.

### Scratch Rehearsal

**Thursday 11th<br>
7.00pm @ Reid Concert Hall**

Join us for a chilled rehearsal – just come along and we’ll sing or play something. This is to give you a little taste of what being in EUMS is like. Tea and biscuits included!

### Scavenger Hunt

**Thursday 11th<br>
9.00pm @ Reid Concert Hall**

After the scratch rehearsal there will be a scavenger hunt – or a pub quiz, if the weather’s rubbish.

### Auditions

**Wednesday 10th – Saturday 13th**

If you’d like to be in either of our orchestras (excluding Sinfonia’s string section, which is not auditioned) you need to audition. Sign up at our bake sale or at the Societies Fair (see above).

We hope to see you at one of our stalls soon!

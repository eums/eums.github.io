Many of you may remember that the Edinburgh University Music Society partnered with Bethany Christian Trust in October to raise money and awareness for their <em>Stop Homelessness</em> campaign. The event was a great success, and we received a lot of positive feedback from attendees and audience members. Around 100 singers joined our orchestra and award-winning conductor Tom Butler to sing Handel's <em>Messiah</em>.

Through entry fees and generous donations we managed to raise a fantastic <strong>Â£1317.06</strong>! This money will go towards supporting homeless people and will directly pay for their accommodation and for the framework to ensure that they are able to raise themselves up onto their own feet.

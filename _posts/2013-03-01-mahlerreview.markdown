> "The orchestra were very aware of the soloist&rsquo;s intimate singing style..."

Last year EUMS Symphony Orchestra brought us [a stunning evening of
Mahler](http://eums.eusa.ed.ac.uk/2012/symphwinter/). Far be it from us to harp
on about how much we loved performing it, [The
Student](http://www.studentnewspaper.org/)'s [Rebecca
O'Doherty](https://twitter.com/odohertyrebecca) gave us a shining review
following the concert. Read it in full below:

>"Friday 23rd November 2012 saw the [Edinburgh
University Music Society's Symphony Orchestra](http://eums.eusa.ed.ac.uk/society/biography/symphony/) 
bring the music of Gustav Mahler to Greyfriars Kirk, Edinburgh. Following the major success
of their programmes last year including performances of [Tchaikovsky's *Sixth Symphony*](http://eums.eusa.ed.ac.uk/2012/spring-symphony/), [*Symphony No.
5* by Sibelius](http://eums.eusa.ed.ac.uk/2012/summerconcert2012/) and [Elgar's *Dream of Gerontius* (with EUMS Chorus)](http://eums.eusa.ed.ac.uk/2011/gerontius/), the
orchestra produced an even more ambitious programme of Mahler's
*Songs of a Wayfarer* featuring solo baritone Douglas Nairne, which were
simply stunning, and the incredible *Symphony No. 1* under the baton of
conductor, [Russell Cowieson](http://eums.eusa.ed.ac.uk/2012/2012-a-great-vintage/).

>"The thought of an entire concert of Mahler
may have caused some apprehension but Gustav himself had originally intended
the two works to be performed side by side and at the concert this proved to be
a success.

>"*Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen* (Songs of a
Wayfarer) was executed beautifully by both the orchestra and soloist. The
orchestra were very aware of the soloist's intimate singing style and
their respectful playing added to this element of intimacy which made the
experience of this work emotive and haunting with particular praise to the
string section and soloists. Highlights were the third and final
song.

>"The concert&rsquo;s second half was Mahler's
*Symphony No. 1*. Despite being an ambitious choice for a university
orchestra, they handled the difficulties well. The third movement was a
particular highlight with the fantastic woodwind soloists getting into
character and providing an impressive display of their talents. The energetic
finale showed that EUMS Symphony Orchestra have an exciting year ahead of them
with a group of dedicated players, great management and an inspirational
conductor."

**With [an inspiring programme of Brahms and Macmillan](/blog/2013/symphony-spring-concert),
Symphony Orchestra are performing in EUMS's Spring Concert Series on the 22nd March. 
Before then, Chorus and Sinfonia are putting on [an epic Mendelssohn
extravaganza](http://eums.eusa.ed.ac.uk/2013/chorussinfoniaspring) on the 15th
of March. For full details and to buy tickets for both of these concerts,

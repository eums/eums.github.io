Intramural hockey is here!

Every year the Music Society enters a team to play mixed hockey against other societies and groups such as the Vets or Agricultural Science boys etc. We had a really great run last year, coming second in our league!

Have no fear if you have never played hockey before: the intramural hockey is great for beginners and it's a fun way to get into the game without the pressure and competitiveness of the actual hockey teams. If you have played hockey before, then you are of course more than welcome to come down and play (of course) for your favourite society!

Matches will be held on Friday evenings or Sundays down at Peffermill astroturfs, and each week I'll be sending you an email to confirm which day and what time.

If you'd like to get involved, then please send an email to social@eums.org.uk which has your full name, matriculation number and a contact number (and your preferred email address if it is different to the one you email me with). Please get in touch as soon as possible so we can organise things like shirt colours and so on&hellip;

Hopefully hear from you soon!

EUMS Tour 2011 has got 9 places left. This is a final call to sign up! I have
to get everyone's names to the ferry company in a couple of weeks time. I
only just found this out, so am obviously delighted that the ferry
people have given me so much notice... If you have signed up, invite your
pals along, we surprisingly have NO groupies so far. This is unusual!
Groupies are welcome! We love groupies!

If you are unsure, stop thinking about it and email me to say you are coming!
It's going to be monumentally great fun! Email me at
[eumstourmanager@gmail.com](eumstourmanager@gmail.com). I cannot emphasise
enough how disappointed you will be if you miss out when everyone gets back and
is talking about it for days, weeks, months and even years to come! Sign up
now, or condemn your soul to a summer of sadness and regret. Tour is THEEEE
best way to start your summer!!

<p style="text-align: justify;">Some may think that the Edinburgh University Music Society could not possibly sustain eleven days of drinking and playing music but Tour 2011 to Belgium and France proved them wrong.<&#47;p></p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="444" caption="Pre-tour rehearsals progressing smoothly..."]<a href="http:&#47;&#47;eums.eusa.ed.ac.uk&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;images&#47;w620&#47;tour08.jpg"><img class="  " title="Pre-tour rehearsals progressing smoothly..." src="http:&#47;&#47;eums.eusa.ed.ac.uk&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;images&#47;w620&#47;tour08.jpg" alt="Pre-tour..." width="444" height="179" &#47;><&#47;a>[&#47;caption]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The orchestra had an exciting program including pieces by Borodin and Mussorgsky, two members of &ldquo;The Mighty Handful&rdquo;, who met in Saint Petersburg, Russia in the years 1856&ndash;1870. Borodin&rsquo;s Polotsvian Dances from the opera Prince Igor is usually performed with a chorus but Nick chose to omit this for our performances (sorry choir). Mussorgsky wrote no less than three versions of Night on a Bare Mountain both with and without chorus which his friend Rimsky-Korsakov (another member of TMH) later &ldquo;corrected&rdquo; into the piece we know and love today.<&#47;p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With pieces like these the playing could not be half hearted, and half hearted it was not. Our instruments had collected a small amount of dust whilst travelling so no-one was really sure how the first concert would go: will I remember the notes? What way do I hold my violin? Am I too hung over to blow into my trumpet? But the audience of St Baafs, Ghent wouldn&rsquo;t have guessed as they listened to the arching phrases and the shimmering in the strings and harp of Wagner&rsquo;s Liebestod or &ldquo;love&rsquo;s death&rdquo; from his opera, Tristan and Isolde. The constant modulation finally ends in a long anticipated resolution of a cadence and was a perfect close to a successful concert mainly energised by who knows what following a night in Bruges.<&#47;p></p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="444" caption="Nick Fletcher leads the Orchestra in Brugge."]<a href="http:&#47;&#47;eums.eusa.ed.ac.uk&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;images&#47;w620&#47;tour03.jpg"><img class="  " title="Nick Fletcher leads the Orchestra in Brugge." src="http:&#47;&#47;eums.eusa.ed.ac.uk&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;images&#47;w620&#47;tour03.jpg" alt="Nick does his thing..." width="444" height="179" &#47;><&#47;a>[&#47;caption]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our next concert was just a walk away from the hostel in Bruges (no need for badly driven buses that day) in a beautiful Catholic Church called Onze Lieve Vrouwekerk (Dutch: Church of Our Lady). However, being a Sunday we were unable to play Tchaikovky&rsquo;s 1812 Overture as it was written to commemorate Russia's defense of Moscow against Napoleon's advancing Grande Arm&eacute;e at the Battle of Borodino and therefore has influences from war. Instead Nick insisted we played Mussorgsky with no rehearsal which was surprisingly flawless considering we hadn&rsquo;t played it for 3 days.<&#47;p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The last concert, this time in Amiens, France, was in Cath&eacute;drale Notre-Dame d'Amiens which reaches a height of 42.30 m and surely enough gave a challenging but impressive acoustic. Luckily we were allowed to play the 1812 and all held our breath as La Marseillaise, the French National anthem, filled the church; the audience didn&rsquo;t seem to mind however, with one man insisting on giving a standing ovation at the end of every piece. So 10 days after we started, a lot of bleary eyes and unhealthy livers returned to Edinburgh leaving me with just one more thing to say&hellip; Happy holidays and see you in September for more buffoonery and of course music making!<&#47;p></p>

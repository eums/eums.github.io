We are excited to announce that our pre-sale tickets for EUMS's Symphony Orchestra and Chorus's Winter Concert in the McEwan Hall this Saturday have now SOLD OUT. There will be a limited number of tickets on the door on the night, so arrive early to avoid disappointment!

The concert is taking place on Saturday 16th November at 7.30pm in the McEwan Hall, Bristo Square. It will be conducted by Russell Cowieson.

Please note - Unfortunately due to unforseen circumstances the previously advertised Pre-Concert Talk will now not be taking place. We apologise for any inconvenience caused.

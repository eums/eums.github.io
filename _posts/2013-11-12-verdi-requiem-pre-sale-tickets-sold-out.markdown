<p>We are excited to announce that our pre-sale tickets for EUMS's Symphony Orchestra and Chorus's Winter Concert in the McEwan Hall this Saturday have now SOLD OUT. There will be a limited number of tickets on the door on the night, so arrive early to avoid disappointment!</p>
<p>The concert is taking place on Saturday 16th November at 7.30pm in the McEwan Hall, Bristo Square. It will be conducted by Russell Cowieson.</p>
<p>Please note - Unfortunately due to unforseen circumstances the previously advertised Pre-Concert Talk will now not be taking place. We apologise for any inconvenience caused.</p>

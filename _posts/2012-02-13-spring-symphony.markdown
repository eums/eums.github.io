Edinburgh University Music Society's Symphony Orchestra present a varied programme for their Spring Concert this year.

The orchestra will be performing three great works: Wagner's musically brilliant <em>Prelude to Parsifal</em>, Rodrigo's <em>Adagio Para Orquesta de Instrumentos de Viento (Adagio for Wind Instruments)</em> and finally Tchaikovsky's mighty <em>Symphony No. 6 in B minor: "Path&eacute;tique"</em>.

This concert sold out in our Winter Concert Series, so book early to avoid disappointment!

*Ticket sales are now closed.*

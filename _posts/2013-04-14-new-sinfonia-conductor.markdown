We are delighted to announce that we have appointed a new conductor for our Sinfonia orchestra! Our beloved Michael Graham will be &mdash; literally &mdash; passing the baton to the wonderful Peter Keenan come September.

Peter read music at the University of York, where he became increasingly in demand as a conductor. Whilst at York, he worked extensively with the university's contemporary music ensemble and was selected as Music Director of the Opera Society. Since graduating he has co-founded a chamber orchestra in the Scottish Borders and worked with various orchestras and ensembles throughout the UK. Peter studies conducting with William Conway and has attended courses with Peter Stark.

We would like to thank Michael Graham for all the excellent work he has done with Sinfonia over the past two years, and wish him the best of luck in his conducting career.

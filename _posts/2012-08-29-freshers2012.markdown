This is the place to be if you want to find out everything about our University of Edinburgh Freshers' Week schedule... For more Freshers' info <a title="EUSA's Fresher's Week website" href="http://www.eusa.ed.ac.uk/freshers2012/" target="_blank">go to the EUSA Freshers' Week 2012 website.</a>

<h3>FRESHERS' WEEK SOCIETIES' FAIR<br>
<em>Wednesday 12th - Thursday 13th</em></h3>

The best place to find out information about the society is by coming and having a chat with us, and as ever, the Edinburgh University Music Society will be manning our stall at the Freshers' Fair.

We will me more than happy to answer questions about anything and everything. There will be flyers and stickers and goodies galore, so make sure you get there early enough to beat the rush (and get a good audition slot).

We will be located in the **Highland Room**. If you head into Pleasance through the main archway, cross the courtyard and turn left in the doorway inside the second arch, the Highland Room is at the top of the stairs. We are near several of the other musical societies, so you can have a mosey at all of them...

<h3>AUDITIONS FOR NEW MEMBERS<br />
<em>Thursday 13th - Saturday 15th</em></h3>

Though our Chorus is non-auditioning, you will need to come to our stall to schedule an audition if you want to play with Symphony Orchestra or Sinfonia (apart from strings for the latter). Here we will give you your Audition Card with your audition time and useful contact details.

Don't be put off if you have additional access needs! If you think access to our audition or rehearsal venues is going to prevent you from getting involved then please <a title="Find the email address you are looking for here." href="/about-us/">speak to one of our Ensemble Managers</a> and we will be more than happy to ensure any problem is resolved to the best of our ability. <a title="Accessibility" href="/accessibility/">Find out more at our Accessibility page</a>.

If, once you have scheduled an audition, you realise that you cannot make it (hangovers do not count: you should have stocked up on detox-smoothie by this point!) then **please contact us as early as possible**.

<h3>SCRATCH REHEARSAL & CEILIDH<br />
<em>Thursday 13th</em></h3>

This year our **Freshers' Week Scratch Rehearsal** is taking place in **St. Peter&rsquo;s Church**, with chorus practising in the church itself and the orchestra in the church hall. There will be free tea, coffee, cake and biscuits to tickle your tastebuds and the rehearsals will take a pretty relaxed format. The rehearsals will start at **18:15**.

Afterwards we are hosting the famous **EUMS Freshers' Week Ceilidh**. Our favourite local ceilidh band will strike up all of the well-known tunes and love guiding everyone through dances you may recognise, and probably a few you don't. If you have never been to a ceilidh or aren't one for remembering dances then don't fret: the band call each dance and there will be lots of other people in the same shoes as you (including most of our current members).

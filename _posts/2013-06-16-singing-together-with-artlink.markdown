**Friday 21st June 7pm** at the **Talbot Rice Gallery**

The Royal Edinburgh Hospital singing group the Heart and Soul
Singsters join forces with the Edinburgh University Music Society
chorus for a massed sing in the Georgian Gallery.

Part of the Ever Present Past programme celebrating 200 years of the
hospital, the massed sing will be a fun event to experiment with the
acoustics of the gallery and for people to experience singing as part
of a big group.

There will be an open rehearsal from 5.30 - 6.30pm to practice the
songs with song leader Penny Stone, which anyone is welcome to join.

People are encouraged to wear something red to make a visual impact.
If you can't make the rehearsal everyone attending the public
performance will be welcome to sing or hum along.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hey Patrick, so you&rsquo;ve just finished a rehearsal with Symphony and it was&nbsp;sounding pretty epic. Can you tell us a bit about yourself and your background&nbsp;as a &lsquo;cellist before you came to Edinburgh?<&#47;strong></p>
<p>Well, where do I start? I&rsquo;ve been playing since I was small. I started in primary&nbsp;school &ndash; just had a teacher right up until I was 17 and was in various orchestras in the&nbsp;&ldquo;burgh&rdquo; [<strong>not our burgh<&#47;strong>] and a few little things here and there and the last thing that&nbsp;I was in before EUMS was the LSSO [<strong>oooo fancy<&#47;strong>].</p>
<p><strong>So I hear there&rsquo;s a lot of gossip in Symphony Orchestra, what&rsquo;s the biggest kept&nbsp;secret in the &lsquo;cello section?<&#47;strong></p>
<p>Oooooo, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s a good thing if I say this... Well I suppose half of&nbsp;us don&rsquo;t practice [<strong>that&rsquo;s boring Patrick, tell us some juicy gossip<&#47;strong>]... Well you&nbsp;know everyone&rsquo;s had a go at each other at some point and I hear there might be&nbsp;some juiciness with a certain 3rd desk &lsquo;cellist... but I better not go there... You&rsquo;ve&nbsp;got to watch out for us at the socials... you don&rsquo;t know what we&rsquo;re going to get up&nbsp;to...especially when the lager starts flowing!</p>
<p><strong>It&rsquo;s apparently a musician thing but everyone has a name for their instrument.&nbsp;What is your beautiful &lsquo;cello called?<&#47;strong></p>
<p>My current &lsquo;cello doesn&rsquo;t have a name, but I called my first one Oliver. [<strong>So we need&nbsp;to start a campaign to name Patrick&rsquo;s &lsquo;cello?<&#47;strong>] well I&rsquo;ll just call him Gregory (it&rsquo;s&nbsp;my middle name).</p>
<p><strong>What other music do you take part in, in Edinburgh?<&#47;strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m part of a band, we play funk and sort of hiphop stuff... but I play bass guitar in&nbsp;that not &lsquo;cello.</p>
<p><strong>If you could play any other music in the orchestra what would it be?<&#47;strong></p>
<p>Trumpet...my brother plays, but it&rsquo;s something you can play anywhere and everyone&nbsp;loves the trumpet [<strong>we at EUMS don&rsquo;t know about that but each to his own!<&#47;strong>]</p>
<p><strong>What has been you most memorable EUMS experience so far?<&#47;strong></p>
<p>Oh definitely VERDI... 100%... yeah. It was brilliant and playing in the massive&nbsp;venue which is the McEwan Hall and everyone really together in a great performance.&nbsp;It was awesome.</p>
<p><strong>If you could swap roles with Russell for one rehearsal what would you like to&nbsp;conduct?<&#47;strong></p>
<p>Something &lsquo;celloy, [have we just created a new word] I guess, like a concerto or&nbsp;something like a &lsquo;cello concerto, because like I play the &lsquo;cello [<strong>we didn&rsquo;t realise you&nbsp;play the &lsquo;cello Patrick, how fantastic!<&#47;strong>]</p>
<p><strong>So what&rsquo;s your favourite &lsquo;cello concerto?<&#47;strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say Dvorak cello concerto because we did it in my orchestra years ago and we&nbsp;went to Prague and played it.</p>
<p><strong>EUMS Symphony is currently working towards a big concert in our spring&nbsp;series. Where and when is it and what are you playing?<&#47;strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ummmm the 14th March at ehhhh Greyfriar&rsquo;s [long pause] Kirk... we are playing Tchaik 4, ehhhh some Wagner and some Canteloube... [<strong>what&rsquo;s the Wagner you&rsquo;re&nbsp;playing Patrick?<&#47;strong>] ehhh, I can&rsquo;t remember even though we played it about 30 seconds&nbsp;ago!</p>

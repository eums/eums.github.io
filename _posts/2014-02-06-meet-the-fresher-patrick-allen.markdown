**Hey Patrick, so you&rsquo;ve just finished a rehearsal with Symphony and it was&nbsp;sounding pretty epic. Can you tell us a bit about yourself and your background&nbsp;as a &lsquo;cellist before you came to Edinburgh?**

Well, where do I start? I&rsquo;ve been playing since I was small. I started in primary&nbsp;school &ndash; just had a teacher right up until I was 17 and was in various orchestras in the&nbsp;&ldquo;burgh&rdquo; **[not our burgh]** and a few little things here and there and the last thing that&nbsp;I was in before EUMS was the LSSO **[ooooh fancy]**.

**So I hear there&rsquo;s a lot of gossip in Symphony Orchestra, what&rsquo;s the biggest kept&nbsp;secret in the &lsquo;cello section?**

Oooooo, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s a good thing if I say this... Well I suppose half of&nbsp;us don&rsquo;t practice **[that&rsquo;s boring Patrick, tell us some juicy gossip]** ...Well you&nbsp;know everyone&rsquo;s had a go at each other at some point and I hear there might be&nbsp;some juiciness with a certain 3rd desk &lsquo;cellist... but I better not go there... You&rsquo;ve&nbsp;got to watch out for us at the socials... you don&rsquo;t know what we&rsquo;re going to get up&nbsp;to...especially when the lager starts flowing!

**It&rsquo;s apparently a musician thing but everyone has a name for their instrument.&nbsp;What is your beautiful &lsquo;cello called?**

My current &lsquo;cello doesn&rsquo;t have a name, but I called my first one Oliver. **[So we need&nbsp;to start a campaign to name Patrick&rsquo;s &lsquo;cello?]** Well I&rsquo;ll just call him Gregory (it&rsquo;s&nbsp;my middle name).

**What other music do you take part in, in Edinburgh?**

I&rsquo;m part of a band, we play funk and sort of hiphop stuff... but I play bass guitar in&nbsp; that's not &lsquo;cello.

**If you could play any other music in the orchestra what would it be?**

Trumpet...my brother plays, but it&rsquo;s something you can play anywhere and everyone&nbsp;loves the trumpet **[we at EUMS don&rsquo;t know about that but each to his own!]**

**What has been you most memorable EUMS experience so far?**

Oh definitely VERDI... 100%... yeah. It was brilliant and playing in the massive&nbsp;venue which is the McEwan Hall and everyone really together in a great performance.&nbsp;It was awesome.

**If you could swap roles with Russell for one rehearsal what would you like to&nbsp;conduct?**

Something &lsquo;cello-y, **[have we just created a new word?]** I guess, like a concerto or&nbsp;something like a &lsquo;cello concerto, because like I play the &lsquo;cello **[we didn&rsquo;t realise you&nbsp;play the &lsquo;cello Patrick, how fantastic!]**

**So what&rsquo;s your favourite &lsquo;cello concerto?**

I&rsquo;d say Dvorak's 'cello concerto because we did it in my orchestra years ago and we&nbsp;went to Prague and played it.

**EUMS Symphony is currently working towards a big concert in our spring&nbsp;series. Where and when is it and what are you playing?**

It&rsquo;s ummmm the 14th March at ehhhh Greyfriar&rsquo;s [long pause] Kirk... we are playing Tchaik 4, ehhhh some Wagner and some Canteloube... **[what&rsquo;s the Wagner you&rsquo;re&nbsp;playing Patrick?]** ehhh, I can&rsquo;t remember even though we played it about 30 seconds&nbsp;ago!

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #67167f;">Saturday 22nd October 2011</span></h3></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #67167f;">St Cuthbert's Parish Church, Edinburgh</span></h3></p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Edinburgh University Music Society and Bethany Christian Trust<br />
are teaming up to bring you The Big Sing 2011.</span></h5></p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">Come along and sing Handel's <em>Messiah</em> under the baton of<br />
award-winning and SPNM short-listed conductor <a title="Find Thomas Butler here..." href="http://www.thomas-butler.co.uk/about.html" target="_blank">Thomas Butler</a> whilst<br />
supporting Bethany's acclaimed "Stop Homelessness" campaign.</span></h5></p>
<p>Scottish charity Bethany Christian Trust and the EUMS invite you to attend Big Sing 2011, a large come-and-sing event where a chorus and our own orchestra will perform Handel's renowned <em>Messiah </em>in St Cuthbert's Parish Church on Lothian Road.</p></p>
<h3>THE EVENT</h3></p>
<p>The event will involve rehearsals throughout the day (with tea and coffee being provided) and a concert in the evening, where performers and audience members will be able to bid for the chance to conduct the <em>Hallelujah Chorus</em> in all of its glory. Music will be available to hire.</p></p>
<p>Unfortunately, <em>we are now going to be unable to provide t-shirts for performers</em>, and as a result the prices to perform have been reduced. Those of you who have paid the original amount will be entitled to a refund of the difference, but remember that this is a charity event, so any donations will be more than welcome. All proceeds will be given to Bethany Christian Trust to support their Stop Homelessness campaign.</p></p>
<p>Concert dress for the day will be <strong>brightly coloured tops</strong>!</p></p>

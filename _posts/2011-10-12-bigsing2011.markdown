Saturday 22nd October 2011<br>
St Cuthbert's Parish Church, Edinburgh
</p>

Scottish charity Bethany Christian Trust and the EUMS invite you to attend Big Sing 2011, a large come-and-sing event where a chorus and our own orchestra will perform Handel's renowned <em>Messiah </em>in St Cuthbert's Parish Church on Lothian Road.

### The event

The event will involve rehearsals throughout the day (with tea and coffee being provided) and a concert in the evening, where performers and audience members will be able to bid for the chance to conduct the <em>Hallelujah Chorus</em> in all of its glory. Music will be available to hire.

Unfortunately, <em>we are now going to be unable to provide t-shirts for performers</em>, and as a result the prices to perform have been reduced. Those of you who have paid the original amount will be entitled to a refund of the difference, but remember that this is a charity event, so any donations will be more than welcome. All proceeds will be given to Bethany Christian Trust to support their Stop Homelessness campaign.

Concert dress for the day will be <strong>brightly coloured tops</strong>!

### On the day

Rehearsals start at 9.45 am, and will continue with frequent breaks until 6.00 pm. The concert will take place at 7.30 with doors opening at 7.00 pm. There will be a bake sale during the day and at the interval in the evening. If you wish to buy tickets to watch the performance in the evening then go the <a title="Bethany Christian Trust &amp; EUMS: Big Sing 2011" href="/blog/2011/bigsingconcert2011/">concert page here</a>.

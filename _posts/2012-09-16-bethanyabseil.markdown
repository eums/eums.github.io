**Saturday 29 September, Barns Ness Lighthouse**

Bethany Christian Trust, a charity that the Edinburgh University Music Society has been working with increasingly in recent years, is running a fantastic event later on this month: an abseil down Barns Ness Lighthouse near Dunbar. The event will raise money for Bethany's <em>Stop Homelessness</em> campaign and is ideal for students wanting a big thrill in aid of charity!

Participants must fulfil a few criteria regarding age and fitness, but otherwise the event is open to everyone!

<p>If you would like to be a member of our Symphony Orchestra, you will need to sign up for an audition during Freshers Week. If you are a wind player who would like to be a member of either Symphony Orchestra or Sinfonia then you will also need to sign up for a Freshers Week audition. &nbsp;However, &nbsp;Sinfonia&nbsp;strings are unauditioned, so if you are a string player who would like to be involved please do come along on Saturday mornings at 10.15 for 10.30 at the Reid Concert Hall - &nbsp;we do recommend that you have reached at least Grade 5 level on your instrument.</p>
<p>You can sign up for an audition in a number of different ways. Firstly, you can contact the orchestra managers directly on symphony@eums.org.uk and sinfonia@eums.org.uk. We will be running a bake sale on the Monday and Tuesday of Freshers Week in Bristo Square where you will also be able to sign up for an audition slot. As well as that, we will have a stall at the Freshers Fair at Pleasance all day Wednesday and Thursday of Freshers Week - come along and say hi, we'd love to have a chat with you and sign you up for an audition there too.</p>
<p>Auditions for returning members (players who have been in the orchestras previously) will be held all day on Wednesday of Freshers Week between 9am and 5pm.</p>
<p>Auditions for returning members and new members will be held between 9am and 5pm on Thursday, - followed by a Scratch Rehearsal and Pub Quiz 6-9.30pm at the Reid, not to be missed!</p>
<p>Further audition slots of new members will be available Friday and Saturday 9am - 5pm.</p>
<p>You will hear back from the committee about the result of your audition on the Sunday of Freshers Week, with rehearsals starting the following week with Symphony Orchestra 6.30-9.30pm on Monday 16th September at the Reid Concert Hall, Chorus 7-9pm on Tuesday 17th September at Patterson's Land, and Sinfonia 10.30am-1.30pm on Saturday 21st September at the Reid Concert Hall.</p>
<p>FOR YOUR AUDITION;</p>
<p>Please prepare a short excerpt&#47;solo piece of music, not to exceed 5 minutes. There will be an accompanist available for you on the day should you require one.</p>
<p>You will then be required to sight read a couple of excerpts from this semester's repertoire.</p>
<p>You will also be asked a few questions about your previous musical experience and current musical activities.</p>
<p>And that's it! Best of luck, please get in touch to arrange an audition!</p>

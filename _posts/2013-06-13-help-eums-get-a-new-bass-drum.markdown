<h4>EUMS needs to raise &pound;1000 to buy a new bass drum to replace our current one (which is worn out). The first milestone we need to meet is our &pound;500 target, and with your kind donations you can help us reach this goal.</h4><br />
To find out more, or to donate, please follow this link: <a href="http://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/eumsbassdrum" target="_blank" rel="nofollow nofollow">www.crowdfunder.co.uk/eumsbassdrum</a></p>
<p>In return, you can receive a range of awards - the more you donate the bigger and better the reward! You could receive discounted or free tickets to EUMS concerts, EUMS Gold membership or even a free music lesson from a member of the society, and much more.</p>
<p>Please let friends and family about this project - with all your help we can get a great bass drum that will be a long term investment for EUMS, allowing us to maintain and develop our musical excellence, particularly for our upcoming November concert of Verdi's Requeim.</p>

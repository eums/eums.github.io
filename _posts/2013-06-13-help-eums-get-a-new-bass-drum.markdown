**EUMS needs to raise £1000 to buy a new bass drum to replace our current one (which is worn out). The first milestone we need to meet is our £500 target, and with your kind donations you can help us reach this goal.**

To find out more, or to donate, please follow this link: <a href="http://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/eumsbassdrum" target="_blank" rel="nofollow nofollow">www.crowdfunder.co.uk/eumsbassdrum</a>

In return, you can receive a range of awards &mdash; the more you donate, the bigger and better the reward! You could receive discounted or free tickets to EUMS concerts, EUMS Gold membership or even a free music lesson from a member of the society, and much more.

Please let friends and family about this project &mdash; with all your help we can get a great bass drum that will be a long term investment for EUMS, allowing us to maintain and develop our musical excellence, particularly for our upcoming November concert of Verdi's Requeim.

> "A nation creates music; the composer only arranges it."<br>
> &mdash; Mikhail Glinka

This is very much the case in our upcoming performance as part of the EUMSs Winter Concert Series. We will be playing a selection of some of the most memorable and intrinsically Russian classical music, starting with Glinka, who is acknowledged as the father of Russian nationalism in music with his famous <em>Ruslan and Lyudmila Overture</em>.

We then move on to the <em>Capriccio Italien</em>, by Tchaikovsky, who was highly influenced by Glinka, claiming that "as the whole oak is in the acorn", so had all of Russian music sprung from him.

The main work in our repertoire is also by Tchaikovsky, with his epic <em>Symphony No.2</em>, or the &ldquo;Little Russian&rdquo; symphony. Based on Ukrainian folksong, this is Russian nationalist music in its prime, with unforgettable melodies, magnificent chords and an undeniably Russian spirit, rounding off a concert that is not to be missed...

Doors open at 7pm, and it is recommended that you arrive early to ensure that you are not disappointed!

<blockquote>
<p>"A nation creates music; the composer only arranges it."<br />
<em>Mikhail Glinka</em></p><br />
</blockquote></p>
<p>This is very much the case in our upcoming performance as part of the EUMSs Winter Concert Series. We will be playing a selection of some of the most memorable and intrinsically Russian classical music, starting with Glinka, who is acknowledged as the father of Russian nationalism in music with his famous <em>Ruslan and Lyudmila Overture</em>.</p></p>
<p>We then move on to the <em>Capriccio Italien</em>, by Tchaikovsky, who was highly influenced by Glinka, claiming that "as the whole oak is in the acorn", so had all of Russian music sprung from him.</p></p>
<p>The main work in our repertoire is also by Tchaikovsky, with his epic <em>Symphony No.2</em>, or the &ldquo;Little Russian&rdquo; symphony. Based on Ukrainian folksong, this is Russian nationalist music in its prime, with unforgettable melodies, magnificent chords and an undeniably Russian spirit, rounding off a concert that is not to be missed...</p></p>
<p>Doors open at 7pm, and it is recommended that you arrive early to ensure that you are not disappointed!</p></p>

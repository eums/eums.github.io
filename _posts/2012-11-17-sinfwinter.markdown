<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"A nation creates music; the composer only arranges it."<br />
<em>Mikhail Glinka<&#47;em><&#47;p><br />
<&#47;blockquote></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is very much the case in our upcoming performance as part of the EUMSs Winter Concert Series. We will be playing a selection of some of the most memorable and intrinsically Russian classical music, starting with Glinka, who is acknowledged as the father of Russian nationalism in music with his famous <em>Ruslan and Lyudmila Overture<&#47;em>.<&#47;p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We then move on to the <em>Capriccio Italien<&#47;em>, by Tchaikovsky, who was highly influenced by Glinka, claiming that "as the whole oak is in the acorn", so had all of Russian music sprung from him.<&#47;p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The main work in our repertoire is also by Tchaikovsky, with his epic <em>Symphony No.2<&#47;em>, or the &ldquo;Little Russian&rdquo; symphony. Based on Ukrainian folksong, this is Russian nationalist music in its prime, with unforgettable melodies, magnificent chords and an undeniably Russian spirit, rounding off a concert that is not to be missed...<&#47;p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Doors open at 7pm, and it is recommended that you arrive early to ensure that you are not disappointed!<&#47;p></p>

<p>Next semester EUMS Sinfonia will be performing Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 1, amongst other works, in their Spring concert on March 15th. </p>
<p>We are looking for an aspiring piano soloist to perform the concerto with us and will be holding auditions for this in early December. Applicants will be expected to perform a short excerpt from the work, which they will be informed of in advance. </p>
<p>This is a fantastic opportunity for pianists to enhance their musical CV whilst gaining the experience of performing with a full-sized symphony orchestra.  </p>
<p>If you are interested in applying for this, please submit a musical CV to president@eums.org.uk by the 8th November, after which the president will contact you with more information about the date and time of the audition. </p>
<p>If you have any questions about this opportunity, please do not hesitate to contact Vicky at president@eums.org.uk.</p>

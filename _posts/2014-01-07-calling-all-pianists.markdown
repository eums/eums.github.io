EUMS is looking for an aspiring student pianist to take on the role of accompanist for EUMS Chorus. This is a role that would begin as soon as possible this semester.

EUMS Chorus is a non-auditioning SATB choir of around 180 members. This semester Chorus will be performing Bernstein's Chichester Psalms alongside other works by Britten and Tavener. Chorus rehearses in Paterson's Land on Tuesday evenings from 18.45-20.45 during term time. For the rest of this academic year Chorus will perform in two more concerts. A concert on the 22nd March and a 20-25 minute performance as part of the EUMS Summer Concert in May 2014.

In order to put on concerts to such a high level, we need an accompanist to support our Chorusmaster. Your responsibilities would be to work with the Chorusmaster when they decide repertoire and a rehearsal schedule, to attend all Chorus rehearsals and to have the pieces to a standard suitable constructive for rehearsal.

This position offers a fantastic opportunity for pianists and aspiring accompanists to work with a large choir and gain valuable experience of this kind of work. Any previous accompanying experience will be useful but is not an essential experience for this role.

Applications for this position should be sent as soon as possible to the EUMS President either by email (president@eums.org.uk) or in writing: The President, Edinburgh University Music Society, c/o Alison House, 12 Nicolson Square, Edinburgh, EH8 9DF. Applications should include a cover letter and a musical CV stating any relevant experience.

If you require any further information please do not hesitate to contact me.

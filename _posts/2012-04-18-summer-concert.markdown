The Edinburgh University Music Society's famous Summer Concert takes place on
Friday the 18th, where we showcase all three of our ensembles under the same

This year we will be performing no fewer than six pieces, ranging from
Britten's *Rejoice In The Lamb* to Sibelius' stunning *Symphony No. 5*.

The EPIC programme for the night will be:

The Edinburgh Charity Orchestra is a new group that has been set up to perform
large scale concerts in order to raise money for and awareness about the work
of local charities. The orchestra is invitation only and draws from some of the
best student and amateur talent in Edinburgh (including many of our own
players), as well as looking to give young professionals experience as
composers, soloists and conductors. The group's conductor, Iain McLarty, is a
well known figure within society circles, and was once conductor of our very
own Sinfonia.

Edinburgh Charity Orchestra's inaugural concert will feature Mahler's epic
first symphony alongside the ever popular second piano concerto by Rachmaninov
and three short pieces by local composer Jake Spence. Come along for a night of
fantastic music and help raise money for a great cause with profits going to
The Yard.

The profits from this concert will be going to The Yard. This is the only
purpose built indoor and outdoor adventure play facility for disabled children
in Scotland. It is run by a team of specialist play workers who inspire, guide
and support the children who visit. The Yard's unique community environment
offers fun and friendship and encourages children to explore, be challenged and
be themselves. You can find out more about it
[here](http://www.theyardscotland.org.uk/).

Edinburgh Charity Orchestra aims to perform large scale concerts in order to

## Who are we?

The Edinburgh University Music Society is widely regarded as one of
Scotland&rsquo;s leading student music organisations, not only in its standard
of performance but also in its involvement within the wider community through
education projects and fundraising concerts.

The society is made up of three ensembles: a non-auditioning Chorus, a
partially-auditioned Sinfonia, and a fully auditioned Symphony Orchestra. Each
ensemble performs at least twice a year, in a variety of locations such as
Usher Hall, McEwan Hall, and Greyfriars Kirk.

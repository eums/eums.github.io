## Who are we?

The Edinburgh University Music Society is widely regarded as one of
Scotland&rsquo;s leading student music organisations&mdash;not only in its
standard of performance, but also in its involvement with the wider community
through education projects and fundraising concerts.

We have three outstanding conductors, two orchestras, a choir, at least six
concerts per year, an annual tour

In addition to this, there are a number of community projects, Innovative
Learning Week events, and an annual tour.

<strong>
&ldquo;I had forgotten how much I adore Schubert’s Unfinished Symphony &hellip;
it is such an emotional work and they carried it off well, the conductor once
again bringing out the best from everyone&rdquo;

<strong>
&ldquo;Am I allowed to say brilliant? The EUMS was stunningly good &hellip;
I’m not sure that I have ever heard a choir cut and start as if the power had
gone off and then on again&rdquo;

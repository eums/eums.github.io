## Who are we?

The Edinburgh University Music Society is widely regarded as one of
Scotland&rsquo;s leading student music organisations&mdash;not only in its
standard of performance, but also in its involvement with the wider community
through education projects and fundraising concerts. 

The society is made up of three ensembles: a non-auditioning Chorus, a
partially-auditioned Sinfonia, and a fully auditioned Symphony Orchestra. Each
ensemble performs at least once per semester in a variety of locations such as
Usher Hall, McEwan Hall, and Greyfriars Kirk.

In addition to this, there are a number of community projects, Innovative
Learning Week events, and an annual tour.

I had forgotten how much I adore Schubert’s Unfinished Symphony– the
clarinet, oboe, bassoon, French horn and flute principals are very
accomplished – it is such an emotional work and they carried it off well, the
conductor once again bringing out the best from everyone &mdash; The Very
Reverend John Mann, St Anne's Cathedral

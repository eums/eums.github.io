Making music The society consists of three ensembles. The largest is Chorus , a non-auditioned choir of more than 100 people, which rehearses on Tuesday evenings in Paterson’s Land. Sinfonia is an auditioned orchestra (apart from the string section, which is non-auditioning). Rehearsals are at the Reid Hall on Saturday mornings. The Symphony Orchestra is a large auditioning orchestra of a very high standard. It is conducted by Russell Cowieson. Rehearsals are on Monday evenings in the Reid Hall. Each ensemble performs 3 times each year, in a total of 6 concerts. In particular, we join Chorus and one of our orchestras for what is always a breathtakingly epic performance in either the Winter or Spring concert series. The Summer concert features all three ensembles performing together under one roof. Socials As you will find out, our passion for music making is at least matched by our love of having a good time: from ceilidhs to karaoke and from defeating our rival societies at hockey to our regular evening pub meetings, we do like to let our hair down, and our members will always be delighted by a new face in the mix. We have all been new to the society at some point! Major features of the EUMS social calendar include sectional meals, tutti weekend, carolling, intramural hockey (we can definitely beat our season’s best of second place this year!), pre-tour karaoke, mass outings to RSNO or SCO concerts, and the highlight of the year: The Musoc Ball (a meal, giant ceilidh and society-wide party). Community engagement As part of our enthusiasm for making music, we spend the whole year getting stuck in with events across the community outside the University of Edinburgh. Every year we have expanded our education projects with local schools, and last year we entertained over 400 pupils in our main Spring event, teaching them about classical music whilst keeping them grinning. We also have a long record of helping local charities, and as part of this continuing tradition we will be working with Bethany Christian Trust once more as part of The Big Sing 2012 . In 2011, the event was well attended and raised over £1300 for the charity’s Stop Homelessness campaign. Tours For most of our members, past and present, the highlight of their years in the society is tour. Every year we grab our instruments, vocal chords and a couple of pairs of knickers (optional) and head off towards the horizon. Recent tours have explored locations as exotic as Norway, Spain, North Wales, Germany, and Northern Ireland! This year we are looking set to travel to the continent once more, though where remains a secret… for now! Tour is the time to really get to know other members, whilst getting the chance to perform in some spectacular venues. Amiens Cathedral has to be a highlight of recent years, with our performance reducing audience members to tears (as we tried not to well up ourselves). Everyone gets to know everyone, and the memories will remain with you as highlights of your university career. Interested? Contact secretary@eums.org.uk or come and find us at one of our rehearsals!

The society also delivers a pioneering education and community programme, and has worked closely with several local charities. Every year the society expands its projects and concerts to give its members and the wider community a better experience, and to align with our society mission. We are run entirely by students who volunteer time out of their degrees through a passion for involvement and inclusion in music. In our 2011/12 season the society spent just under £40,000 on our events and projects, and this figure builds year on year. As we gain more support we are able to expand our horizons further, putting on bigger and better concerts and reaching further and further into the wider community.

This concert was given by an orchestra consisting primarily of students of the university, and later that year the group was formally constitutionalised as the Edinburgh University Musical Society. In his time at the University of Edinburgh he continued to expand the society and used his connections with other composers and players to arrange larger and more extravagant performances, most being held within what is now known as the Assembly Rooms on George Street. His legacy as our founder remains with us, and even now we still possess pieces that he arranged and composed in his time with us.</p> Oakeley was born on the 22nd of July 1830 in Ealing, London. Having spent much of his youth in Rugby, he went on to study at Ox­ford Un­i­ver­si­ty, later spending time in the renowned German conservatoires in Leip­zig, Dres­den and Bonn. He moved to Scotland in the late 1850s, and gained the University of Edinburgh's Reid Chair of Music in 1865. He progressed music within the university significantly, holding the Chair until 1891. During this time he arranged and composed many musical works, and exerted a strong influence on music across the United Kingdom. In 1871 Scottish Archbishop of Canterbury Archibald Tait awarded him a doctorate of music, and in 1876 he was presented with a knighthood from Queen Victoria.</p> He had written several pieces for Victoria personally and these had been \"warmly received\"; he continued to write pieces for events where she was to be received until her death in 1901 (some of these have in fact recently surfaced in our own archives), having gained the position of  Composer of Mu­sic to Queen Victoria in Scotland</em> in 1881.</p> Oakeley died in Eastbourne on the 26th of October, 1903 at the ripe old age of 73. His legacy lives on in his music, the advances that were made within the Reid School of Music during his tenure as Professor of Music at the university and in our society, the EUMS, still going from strength to strength two centuries on from when he lifted up his conductors baton all the way back in 1867...</p> The Formative Years · Reaching The Tonne</a> · Changes Afoot</a> · The Golden Years</a></small></h4> "},{"title":"Reaching The Tonne: 1941 - 1971","url":"/about-us/history/1941-1971/","date":null,"categories":[],"body":"Reaching The Tonne: 1941 - 1971</h1> asdasdad The Formative Years</a> · Reaching The Tonne · Changes Afoot</a> · The Golden Years</a></small></h4> "},{"title":"History","url":"/about-us/history/","date":null,"categories":[],"body":" Our History “The annual concert of the Edinburgh University Musical Society was held last night in the Music Hall, which assumed its gala dress for the occasion, being decorated with palms and other hothouse plants, contributed by the Professor of Botany. There was a large attendance. Since its establishment, in 1867, this meritorious Society has never been in such a condition of prosperity as at present.” This was written about the society in a March 1873 edition of the Scotsman newspaper. The piece goes on to describe the society’s makeup: “Professor [Herbert] Oakeley assumed the baton, and his ease, precision, and perfect rapport with all the performers were as conspicuous as at last year’s concert. The chorus numbered about 85 voices, and the orchestra 60 performers…” It is very interesting to read about the society in its earliest years, and to see how little has changed since the mid- to late-1800s. Read the full article here . The Edinburgh University Music Society is the oldest student musical society in Scotland, and can be traced back to its origins in a concert in February of 1867: the 27th Reid Memorial Concert. This concert was unusual in that, rather than exclusively relying on the professional players within Edinburgh at the time (as had been the norm up until this point) the performance was cast as a “ University Amateur Concert .” It consisted of a selection of musicians from around the University of Edinburgh, most students, some academics, and others members of the St. Cecilia Instrumental Society. They were led by the then Professor of Music, Herbert Oakeley, and in George Street’s Music Hall (now the Assembly Rooms) provided such a grand performance that students and academics alike started scratching their head. Chief among these was Oakeley. They began pondering upon the possible creation of a new society dedicated to the inclusion of students in an orchestral setting, in order to produce high quality music and introduce students to the rigours of performance. That summer a draft constitution was set down, and at the commencement of the next academic year the first students rehearsed under Oakeley for the first time in what became known as the Edinburgh University Musical Society . Early records exist of a performance by the society was in 1872, where they performed alongside the Hallé Orchestra from Manchester and some of the most famous artists of the time in a three day festival devoted to the continuation of General John Reid’s passion for music. Read more about Reid’s importance for music in the University of Edinburgh here . The society, now and for many decades the largest outside the University of Edinburgh’s Sports Union, has a long history of representing the University of Edinburgh through the quality of its performances. Carl Orff’s Carmina Burana was premiered in Scotland by the EUMS in 1963, and the BBC has made recordings of several of our concerts. In 2007, the society celebrated its 140th anniversary with a series of concerts in the impressive McEwan Hall, ending with a stunning rendition of Verdi’s Requiem to a thousand-strong audience. Since those early days in the late-1800s, the society has performed hundreds of concerts in Edinburgh, and in recent years the quality of our music has only got better, despite an increasing concentration on matters beyond performance. View a selection of posters collected from our concerts . Our history has given us great strength as a society, but we also look forward to seeing what the years ahead can bring us. We hope you will enjoy following the Edinburgh University Music Society through the years, as we enjoy being involved in such an important part of Scotland’s heritage and culture.

We get a great reception wherever we go, and we enjoy playing different venues in different places.</p> There is only one place that we can call home though: Edinburgh. And it is in Edinburgh where we have been performing since our creation in 1867, in a number of venues across the city.</p> In recent years the four venues where we have tended to perform are St. Cuthbert's Church at the end of Princes Street, the Reid Concert Hall on Bristo Square, Greyfriars Kirk just off George IV Bridge and our largest current venue, St. Mary's Cathedral on Palmerston Place. These venues are shown below:</p> </iframe><br /> View EUMS Concert Venues</a> in a larger map</small> BY TRAIN</strong></h2> The best way to access St. Cuthbert's Church and St. Mary's Cathedral from outside Edinburgh is by train, getting off at Haymarket station and making your way by foot along Shandwick Place. If you don't fancy trudging through the rain then there is a taxi rank at the station and as these two venues are quite close, it won't cost you too much.</p> Access to our other venues by train is also quite straightforward. Getting off at Waverley station and making your way up to the bus stop on Waverley Bridge will allow you to catch either of buses  41 or 42 </em>down George IV Bridge to Greyfriars Kirk or the Reid Concert Hall.</p> BY BUS</strong></h2> If you live within Edinburgh, then the bus provides the easiest way to get to our venues. Bus numbers 12, 26, 31 and 48</em> stop on Haymarket Terrace, near Palmerston Place and St. Mary's Cathedral. Bus numbers 41 and 42</em> stop near Greyfriars Kirk and the Reid Concert Hall. For access to St. Cuthbert's Church, buses 1, 10, 11, 15, 16, 22, 24, 30 and 34</em> stop on Lothian Road. For further details of buses around the city, go to the Lothian Bus website</a>.</p> BY CAR</strong></h2> Though driving is not the best option for getting around Edinburgh, sometimes it is unavoidable. Access for St. Mary's and St. Cuthbert's is easiest when approaching the city centre from the west. Parking space is at best limited for these venues, and you may have to park some distance away.</p> Access to Greyfriars Kirk and the Reid Concert Hall can be made from either the city centre or the south, though the latter is advisable. Following the A701 into the city and turning left and left again onto Buccleuch Street at the Blockbuster will take you up to Bristo Square and beyond up to Greyfriars Kirk. Again, parking is nearly impossible, so you will need to find somewhere to park and walk to the venue.</p> It is our intention that our chosen venues are easily accessible for all, no matter where you are travelling from. The most important thing is that you enjoy the concert on the night!</p> "},{"title":"The Golden Years: 2000 - present","url":"/about-us/history/2000-present/","date":null,"categories":[],"body":"The Golden Years: 2000 - present</h1> asdasdad The Formative Years</a> · Reaching The Tonne</a> · Changes Afoot</a> · The Golden Years</small></h4> "},{"title":"Education Projects","url":"/community/education/springproject/","date":null,"categories":[],"body":"Education Projects</strong></h1> The Edinburgh University Music Society has a particular interest in its involvement with potential and budding musicians and has for many years taken part in activities across Edinburgh (and indeed the rest of Scotland), promoting music and getting children involved in classical music.</p> As part of this, every year we run a series of hour-long education projects aimed at P6 and P7 pupils from local primary schools, performing some classical pieces alongside a number of more contemporary arrangements (so anything from Ride of the Valkyries to Lady Gaga).</p> The Event</h2> The project is structured like a performance, with our cheerful presenters guiding the audience through the various sections of the orchestra and chorus, and of course there is plenty of opportunity for the audience to get involved (often with brilliant, if amusing, results).</p> [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"372\"] <img class=\" \" title=\"Warming up for a sing-song...\" src=\"http://eums.eusa.ed.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/images/w620/education3.jpg\" alt=\"Education project in the Reid Hall\" width=\"372\" height=\"150\" /></a> Warming up for a sing-song...[/caption] The purpose of the day is to introduce the children to the world of orchestral and choral music, showcasing different sections of the orchestra and choir through arrangements of music that will be familiar to them, and music that will excite and impress (but not intimidate) them.</p> “I didn’t really think about classical music in films like Pirates of the Caribbean </em>and Harry Potter</em>.

Combining quality of music with a wide repertoire, EUMS requires commitment at all levels. The Society continues to grow in strength, and this is in no small part due to the dedication of our team of conductors. Neil Metcalfe Numbering over 100, the EUMS Chorus requires a conductor with a considerable amount of skill and dedication, not to mention a lot of patience. Thankfully, our conductor is more than capable of guiding the talents of the Chorus to bigger and better things year on year. Neil Metcalfe read music at the University of Edinburgh before taking-up a scholarship in the opera school of the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama, where he trained as a répétiteur, vocal coach, pianist, continuo player and conductor. He worked for a number of years on the music staff of Scottish Opera, in opera houses in Australia (Sydney), Germany (Dortmund), the United States (Pittsburgh), Northern Ireland (Belfast), and also with many touring companies including Bolshoi Opera, Kirov Opera, Catalan National Theatre, and Deutsche Oper am Rhein. As a performer he has recorded for the BBC (most recently with National Girls’ Choir of Scotland) and on the Linn Records label (most recently with Dunedin Consort in JS Bach’s Mass in B Minor ) and enjoys a busy career as a solo artist, accompanist, MD and conductor. He has appeared in venues as far afield as Greenland and Australia in a wide number of genres from musical theatre to chamber music. He is also a keen supporter of young people in music; he is chairman of the Scottish Schools Orchestra, a trustee of Edinburgh Young Musicians, and works as an examiner and adjudicator. Neil currently holds the posts of musical director of Edinburgh Grand Opera, Edinburgh Music Theatre Company, Balerno Theatre Company, our very own EUMS Chorus, Edinburgh Studio Opera, the Maltings Theatre and Opening Night Productions. He is also lecturer in Performance Studies at Stevenson College, Edinburgh. Peter Keenan Sinfonia has a long history of being led by exciting, fresh faced new conductors with a knack for bringing out the best in the ensemble and a flask of coffee to get them through Saturday morning rehearsals. Peter Keenan joined St Mary’s Music School in 2005, where his studies included composition with Tom David Wilson, viola with Cathy Marwood and piano with Richard Beauchamp and John Cameron. During this time, Peter was awarded several prizes for composition and piano recitals in both local and national competitions. In 2011 Peter completed the BA (Hons) music degree at the University of York. During this time Peter began conducting, initially with the Chimera Ensemble (specialising in contemporary music). Highlights included Philip Cashian’s Chamber Concerto, Hans Abrahamsen’s Lied in Fall and his own father, Paul Keenan’s, The Ruin . Other highlights include being Music Director of the University of York Opera Society, with whom he conducted a staged production of Mozart’s The Magic Flute . Peter studies with William Conway and has attended conducting courses with Peter Stark. He intends to further his studies at postgraduate level, with the aim of specialising in the operatic oeuvre of Mozart. Peter also works as a freelance music engraver. He recently contributed to the Giovanni Simon Mayr Werkausgabe (Ricordi) and is currently creating the piano reduction of a new opera by Pelle Gudmundsen-Holmgreen (Edition Wilhelm Hansen), amongst other projects. Russell Cowieson Russell Cowieson studied on a McFarlane scholarship at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama (winning the premier performance prize, the Governors Recital prize) and the Guildhall School of Music in London. As a performer he has appeared with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, the RSNO Wind Ensemble, Carol Kidd, Carla Bley and the Stan Tracey Quartet. His conducting studies were undertaken with Timothy Reynish, Baldur Brönnimann and George Hurst. He is currently Musical Director of our very own Symphony Orchestra. His work with EUMS has gained much praise. Our concerts regularly sell out and have seen Symphony Orchestra tackle a wide range of challenging repertoire. Future plans include the commencement of work on an exciting new project which will see them perform James Macmillan’s The Confession of Isobel Gowdie in Dundee’s Caird Hall, to a specially created choreography for over 200 young dancers. Deeply committed to education, Russell was the first recipient of the Yamaha Instrumental Teacher of the Year award. In 2007 Russell was appointed Artistic Director of the International Wind Festival held at the RSAMD. Since 2008 he has served regularly on the faculty of the Royal Northern College of Music, Conductor Training Weekend and since 2009 he has been a member of faculty at the internationally renowned Canford Summer School of Music as teacher of conducting. Russell has worked with Young Sinfonia, the RNCM Junior School Orchestra, RSAMD Wind Orchestra, RSAMD Junior School, as a visiting specialist, adjudicator and examiner to the RSAMD, with the Scottish Schools Orchestra Trust, John Currie Singers and Orchestra, Cambridge Holiday Orchestra, Cambridgeshire Youth Wind Orchestra and Dundee Schools Symphony Orchestra.

Through our work in education we try to reach those who haven’t had the opportunity to discover if music is something that can really excite them. Our ensembles are primarily classical ensembles so a big part of our work in education is encouraging the promotion of classical music, but we also try to spread the message that music is thrilling and versatile, and that any genre of music leads on easily to others. A lot of our work so far has been with children, but one of our aims for the future is to work more closely with teenagers; in particular working to inspire them to continue with music after they leave school. Music-making is a fantastic thing to do at any age! Take a look at the upcoming projects part of our website to find out about the ways you can get involved. Spring Education Project Every Spring we hold our annual Education Project; we collaborate with several local primary schools to show P5s - P7s what we do. We de-construct an orchestra and choir, providing a chance for them to learn about classical music. We’ve had a great response from the children in recent years, and as the project develops we try to tailor it more and more to what cannot be provided in the classroom. It’s a fantastic introduction to classical music, and we hope to inspire children to take up or continue their own music-making. To find out more about this project please click here . “Be it through being inspired by watching a concert or learning something new by speaking to one of our performers, the Edinburgh University Music Society provides the perfect environment to enthuse young talent to get involved with classical music” Young musicians A great way to introduce your children to classical music is to bring them along to one of our concerts. Children are always welcome, and we are more than happy to have a chat with our audience at the interval or after the performance. If you’re not sure who to speak to, ask for the Community Relations Manager and they’ll be more than happy to introduce you to some of our musicians and singers. We are always enthusiastic to speak to interested aspiring musicians, young or old. Who knows? The young musicians of today are undoubtedly the Edinburgh University Music Society of tomorrow. Drake Music Scotland EUMS’s most recent collaboration has been with the charity Drake Music Scotland , which concentrates on creating opportunities for children and adults to learn, compose and perform music independently. We are eager to learn from them about how we can make our ensembles, projects and concerts more easily accessible to disabled children and adults, and to promote the excellent work they do. We very much look forward to working with them in the near future; to find out more about Drake Music Scotland follow this link . Something worth encouraging At the university level our society tries to provide the best possible musical opportunities for students as well as non-students through our ensembles, and we recognise that a high standard of music-making can only be maintained if the initial inspiration is in place. EUMS would just like to use this space to say a massive thank you to all our music teachers who have inspired us to pursue our music-making , and we hope to keep learning from their good work by giving back to the community what we’ve found is something worth encouraging.

We have performed hugely popular pieces, most recently including (though not exclusively) Elgar's Dream of Gerontius , Carl Orff's Carmina Burana , Shostakovich's Tenth Symphony and Rimsky-Korsakov's fantastic Scheherazade . We have also showcased numerous specially commissioned or new pieces, engaging our players in the more contemporary realms of classical music. No matter what pieces we are playing, you can be assured that we will be enjoying every minute of the performance, and we hope that you as an audience will be too! We also run many social events for our members, allowing us to get to know each other a little better and also to let our hair down away from the stresses of university life...

"},{"title":"What's on","url":"/whats-on/","date":null,"categories":[],"body":"What’s on Summer Concert Freshers' Week Bake Sale Past events » We are proud of the quality of our ensembles. Since the society’s creation in 1867, our concerts have been performed to an incredibly high standard and have received critical acclaim alongside warm support from our audiences. We perform six main concerts a year, with a Winter concert series, a Spring concert series and a Summer concert. Each year one of our concerts also includes a joint collaboration between the Chorus and one of either Sinfonia or Symphony Orchestra. Concerts usually take place in the same venues (see where we perform ), and are easily accessible from the centre of Edinburgh. Tickets can be bought on the door, but we sell tickets in advance online and at rehearsals. Prices are very reasonable, and we offer further concessions to students and under-16s. Further booking options are available for larger groups. Our concerts always start at 7.30pm with doors usually opening at 7pm. We know that sometimes there is a lot to think about when attending a classical concert, especially if it is your first, so we have compiled a list of frequently asked questions . "},{"title":"Sinfonia","url":"/sinfonia/","date":null,"categories":[],"body":" Sinfonia Sinfonia is a semi-auditioned full symphony orchestra that rehearses every Saturday morning from 10.30 am to 1.30 pm in the Reid Concert Hall, Bristo Square under the baton of Peter Keenan . The orchestra aims to provide an opportunity for keen string players to get a chance to rehearse and perform with a full scale orchestra without the stress of auditions, whilst also trying to create enough of a challenge for the auditioned woodwind, brass and percussion sections. Auditions take place during Freshers Week at the beginning of every academic year and involve performing a previously selected piece of music as well as some sight reading. All string players are welcome to join the orchestra without auditioning, although we expect a standard of at least ABRSM grade 6 (grade 8 is ideal) to cope with the challenging repertoire. Like the society’s other ensembles, Sinfonia holds a concert towards the end of every term in venues such as the Reid Concert Hall, Greyfriars Kirk and St Mary’s Cathedral. Recent concerts have included performances of challenging works such as Tchaikovsky’s Symphony No. 2 and Capriccio Italien , Pomp and Circumstance Marches by Elgar and Sibelius Symphony No. 3 . Have a listen to a recording of us performing Wagner’s Overture to Die Meistersinger von Nurnberg . Every other year, the orchestra joins forces with the society’s Chorus to perform a large scale orchestral and choral piece. Last year such a collaboration took place with the two ensembles delivering a superb performance of Mendelssohn’s Symphony No. 2 “Lobgesang” in St. Mary’s Cathedral on Palmerston Place. Sinfonia further serves as a platform for talented student soloists to perform with a full orchestra. Recently this has included a highly acclaimed performance of Saint-Saëns Cello Concerto No. 1 . Last but not least, Sinfonia has a lot to offer from a social perspective too. Social activities include lunch in Teviot after every rehearsal, as well as sectional meals and other events with the whole of the society. For further details, please get in touch with our Sinfonia Manager at sinfonia@eums.org.uk .

As one of our oldest traditions, it is considered by many as the highlight of the year, and usually functions as a terrific holiday for the majority of our members who have had to endure a difficult university exam period.</h6></p> <h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Our Tour</h2></p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The society is a large one, with over three hundred members, and so tour provides the perfect surroundings for everyone to get to know each other that bit better. New friendships are forged and old ones strengthened, and for those who haven’t toured with an orchestra before, it is certainly an experience not to miss, with the society performing high quality music to a varied audience in new and interesting venues.</p></p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We have travelled across Europe, to places as far away as Galway in Ireland and Bergen in Norway, and to many of the places between. We also tour across the UK, having recently toured to the Scottish Highlands and to Northern England. Wherever we go, it can be assured that a great time will be had by all.</p></p> <h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">What We Get Up To</h2></p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Tour generally takes the form of a number of performances in a few major venues in the region we have travelled to, and alternates every year between a British and International location. We tend to stay in local youth hostels, and owing to the fact that the tour is organised by our members rather than a body of well-financed elders, it tends to offer excellent value for money.</p></p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Tour is the perfect way to get to know the society, and indeed for the society’s members to get to know one another. During the day when we aren’t rehearsing we have plenty of time to have a mosey about and soak in some of the “daytime” culture. Museums, cafés, shopping, parks and extended games of frisbee all feature prominently. Following our concert, we enjoy an evening together sampling the delights of the local watering holes, and quite often end up dancing the night away in the local discotheque.</p></p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The fun starts well before we get on the bus too. “Pretour” as it has come to be known involves rehearsals and a social or two, usually in the form of karaoke or a ceilidh, allowing the louder folks in the society to succeed in making fools of themselves and also to let the quieter members put the rest of us to shame with their sing-along prowess.</p></p> <h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Bringing Us Together</h2></p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Tour succeeds every year in bringing together a large number of like-minded people and letting them make great music and have a terrific time in doing so.

Rossauro: Rhapsody for Percussion and Orchestra</em></strong> This was performed at the Symphony Orchestra concert in November 1998 and featured Matt Birch as the soloist on the percussion. This proved to be a very different and unusual concert which provoked a lot of \"What on earth is that?\"-ing from audience members as yet another weird and wonderful instrument was picked up! Bizet: Carmen</em></strong> This concert staging of the opera Carmen </em>was a somewhat different venture for the EUMS in which we needed no less than 8 soloists and a great many rehearsals. Thankfully the brass section of the orchestra were rescued by Teviot's 99p pints which they made great use of during the rehearsal breaks (Alas! Gone are the days of such prices... Inflation has taken its toll). This concert again proved popular with some for singing on the coach on that year's tour to Prague but they were gagged and bound until they promised only to sing Mahler 8. Verdi: Massa da Requiem</em></strong> Another time, another Verdi Requiem. Not to be confused with the 2007 140th Anniversary</em> rendition, this concert was an all time classic, with the unforgettable Dies Irae echoing grandly about the Usher Hall. This was our last concert in the Usher Hall before it was closed for restoration work so many years ago... Mahler: Symphony No. 8</em></strong> One of the greatest EUMS concerts of all time. The archetypal EUMS concert - our epic rendition of this masterpiece sadly fading even from the minds of oldest members of the society - consisted of a chorus of well over 300 and a huge orchestra of 150. Echoes of grand concerts on this scale resurface from time to time, but they often peter out to nought but a whisper.   "},{"title":"Chorus","url":"/chorus/","date":null,"categories":[],"body":" Chorus The Edinburgh University Music Society Chorus is one of the largest choirs in Scotland, performing several times a year in front of large audiences. It is a non-auditioning SATB symphonic chorus, and we welcome both students and non-students as members. Rehearsals take place every Tuesday from 6.30pm until 8.45pm in Room G1, Paterson’s Land, Holyrood Road during University term-time. It is conducted by Neil Metcalfe . As with the other ensembles of EUMS, Chorus puts on a concert at the end of each semester in various venues including St. Cuthbert’s Church, Greyfriars Kirk and St. Mary’s Episcopal Cathedral. Though the Chorus is non-auditioning, the quality of our performances is very high, and with the numbers behind us we produce a fantastic sound. Don’t take our word for it; listen to a concert recording of us performing Rossini’s Messe Solennelle . Our Chorus performs challenging pieces of music from a wide classical repertoire, with recent works including Bernstein’s Chichester Psalms , Jenkins’ The Armed Man and Verdi’s Messa de Requiem . Chorus also collaborates with one of our orchestras once a year to perform large choral works, which have recently included Mendelssohn’s Symphony No.2 Hymn of Praise and the 2011 sell-out concert Elgar’s Dream of Gerontius . Though there is no requirement to read music, it can certainly help; but whether you are a mini-maestro or indeed a hairbrush singer, then there is certainly a place for you.

The society is a great way to meet all sorts of people. No matter what your musical background, there is always a place for you within one of the ensembles, allowing you to broaden your musical horizons as well as having a great time along the way. Whether you are an undergraduate, postgraduate or just someone who has heard about what we do, all you have to do is come along and speak to one of our dedicated committee members. Find out more about getting involved . The society also gets involved with the community, and plays an active role in bringing music to the schools in and around Edinburgh. In recent years interaction between the society and the community has increased a great deal, and there are several annual events that take place involving local primary and secondary schools and a number of our members, guiding them to create music and learn new skills whilst also, of course, having fun. The Edinburgh University Music Society strives to bring out the best in everyone through the collision of talent and character, and in doing so present the ability of the University to perform excellent music with versatility and brilliance. History The society was founded in 1867 by Sir Herbert Oakeley. Following the ancient University’s long musical tradition, which began formally in 1839 when the origins of today’s music department were founded as a result of a bequest from General John Reid, the Music Society tied together many casual musical groups that had existed previously. Throughout the twentieth century the society took part in larger and more extravagant performances, and this tradition has certainly not waned. Recent performances include Elgar’s Dream of Gerontius and Orff’s Carmina Burana , and with six major concerts a year the society’s repertoire is extensive. Learn more about the society’s history . The committee The society is run by an elected group of sixteen members known as the committee. These include our office bearers (the President, Secretary and Treasurer), Ensemble Managers and Librarians, Publicity Managers, Social Secretaries, Community Relations Manager, Tour Manager and our Sponsorship and Alumni Manager. Though the committee lead the organisation of the Society and its events, all members are encouraged to get involved, and many of our additional activities are organised by non-committee members.

It is the society’s only fully auditioned ensemble, rehearsing every week in term-time from 6.30 to 9.30pm on a Monday evening in the Reid Concert Hall, Bristo Square. Conducted by the ever passionate Russell Cowieson , the orchestra aims to provide students with the opportunity to play large-scale orchestral works to a very high standard. Concerts are given at the end of each semester in various locations around Edinburgh, including Greyfriars Kirk and St Mary’s Cathedral. Recent works have included Tchaikovsky’s Sixth Symphony, Rimsky Korzakov’s Scheherazade and Respighi’s Pines of Rome. Feel free to have a listen to an excerpt from a concert recording of Shostakovich’s Tenth Symphony . Every two years the orchestra teams up with the EUMS Chorus to perform large scale orchestral and choral works in one of its concerts. Recently performed pieces include Orff’s Carmina Burana and Verdi’s Requiem with soloists from within the music society as well as professional singers. Last year Symphony Orchestra teamed up with the Chorus to perform The Dream of Gerontius by Elgar. As a group of musicians, Symphony Orchestra has a diverse membership and an impressive track record in engaging with our wider community. In 2012 alone the orchestra comprised players from 16 different countries including the Czech Republic, France, the Netherlands, Latvia, Spain, the USA, Hong Kong, Germany and Sweden, and through both our extensive education projects and outreach programmes commits itself to helping communicate the benefits and delights of classical music for everyone. In 2013 this has included a grand rendition of MacMillan’s The Confession of Isobel Gowdie with over 200 children in Dundee’s Caird Hall as part of a specially commissioned youth dance performance.

When do you clap? What happens if you are late? Should you wear a bow-tie? As it happens there aren't really any rules, and people have just tended to do the same thing since the first music concerts many years ago...</p> At the Edinburgh University Music Society we want you to come to our concerts and relax, enjoy the music and have a terrific evening, and so we have answered a few of the questions you might be pondering upon below. If we haven't answered your question here then feel free to get in touch</a>!</p> Is there a dress code?</strong></h3> Only for the players! Though an EUMS concert is a good excuse to dress up, we don't mind if you turn up in jeans and trainers either.</p> Can I bring my children?</strong></h3> We welcome children to all EUMS concerts, and you can get reduced-price tickets for under-16s.</p> What time do the doors open?</strong></h3> The majority of EUMS concerts begin at 7.30pm, which means that doors open at around 7pm.</p> Can I buy a ticket on the door?</strong></h3> We always sell tickets for our concerts on the door, though we would always recommend booking in advance to make sure you aren't disappointed.</p> Are there discounted tickets?</strong></h3> EUMS offer a concessionary ticket for all concerts. For example, if the full price is £8, then the concessionary ticket will cost £5.</p> Do you sell programmes?</strong></h3> Programmes are sold at the front-of-house for a small cost, and provide details of the pieces, the performers and of any upcoming EUMS events.</p> What if my friends or I are late?</strong></h3> You will be allowed into the concert at a suitable break in the programme, though you will be requested to wait until the interval if you are particularly late.</p> Can I take photos?</strong></h3> We ask that you don't take photos during the performance since this can be distracting to the players and our other audience members, especially if the flash goes off! We also ask you politely not to make audio or video recordings of the music as this is illegal, even if it is just for your own enjoyment.</p> How long is the interval?</strong></h3> Most concerts have 20 minute intervals, but there may be a few with shorter or long intervals, or indeed none at all.</p> Are the queues for the toilets really long?</strong></h3> Some of our venues only have a couple of toilets, but there are usually ample facilities for even the most well-watered audiences!</p> When should I clap?</strong></h3> There are no set rules for when you should clap, though in the UK it is traditional to clap at the end of a piece of music, as opposed to after each movement. This is to help the music flow smoothly or to set the scene for the following movement. Your programme should give you a clue as to how many movements there are. If in doubt, keep an eye on the conductor who will usually provide a signal that the piece has ended. If you are really unsure then the best plan is to wait for others to start. Don't worry about it: we love it when our audience expresses their delight at our performance!</p> "},{"title":"New Website Finally Up And Running!","url":"/blog/2011/helloworld/","date":"2011-03-27 00:00:00 +0000","categories":["news"],"body":"Well, following a year of speculation and a day or so of hard graft, the 2011 facelifted EUMS website is up and running, if still in its infancy… The new website provides access to more details about the society and what we do, and also provides further details for the events we do outside of the concert season.

A completely unaccompanied programme, including a newly written piece hot off the press from the Royal Wedding of Wills and Kate— Ubi Caritas — by Paul Mealor was a huge success, written for a choir of small boys and men singing alto, chorus just did it without the small boys… Labelled a hit at the royal wedding, it succeeded in being one on tour as well. A large section of our concerts each day (to the orchestra’s delight) was dedicated to the 15 minute long Allegri Miserere . The latin wasn’t perfect but we had fun in making it up. Bruckner motets opened our concerts and softened us in to whatever echoing and wonderfully large place of worship we were in that day. A round and blended sound, these pieces gave us time to settle and show that a large choir of our number could still capture quieter moments. Leading onto my favourite piece of tour, Whitaker’s Sleep giving us both the opportunity to capture quiet moments and indulge in the huge soaring lines, this piece had everything! All of the music was under the steady hand of Nicholas Fletcher, the clashing dissonances, sumptuous harmonies and overall the thrilling ride of singing on a hangover, much fun was had by all.

During this year I have found the weekly singing sessions to be an incredible break from studying and have been a great relaxing and creative pastime. Throughout this year I have met many people from Chorus, however I have found that it was MUSOC tour that gave me the opportunity to make great friends with not only these Chorus members but orchestra members too. This year we travelled by bus and ferry to Belgium in which we did two concerts: one in Ghent and one in Bruges. We then jumped back on the buses and journeyed onto Amiens where we performed our last concert. Although the bus journeys sound like they could be not so fun they were actually a great bonding session and of course being MUSOC, endless hilarious songs were sung. After spending a long time on a bus singing these songs our behaviour was hardly going to change when we continued our journey on the long over night ferry arriving in Holland. It was glorious weather and so we all gathered on top deck of the ferry where the songs continued and in a way it could have been our first performance! We were extremely lucky and with the help of our incredibly organised committee members and tour manager Andy Laing our concert venues were stunning. Amiens Cathedral was by far the largest venue and for me the most poignant concert. Having not known many people in MUSOC before tour I have been able to get to know so many incredible and fun people. I am so glad I chose to go on tour and am looking forward to the next one! Thank you to everyone who helped make MUSOC tour so amazing.

Borodin’s Polotsvian Dances from the opera Prince Igor is usually performed with a chorus but Nick chose to omit this for our performances (sorry choir). Mussorgsky wrote no less than three versions of Night on a Bare Mountain both with and without chorus which his friend Rimsky-Korsakov (another member of TMH) later “corrected” into the piece we know and love today. </p> With pieces like these the playing could not be half hearted, and half hearted it was not. Our instruments had collected a small amount of dust whilst travelling so no-one was really sure how the first concert would go: will I remember the notes? What way do I hold my violin? Am I too hung over to blow into my trumpet? But the audience of St Baafs, Ghent wouldn’t have guessed as they listened to the arching phrases and the shimmering in the strings and harp of Wagner’s Liebestod or “love’s death” from his opera, Tristan and Isolde. The constant modulation finally ends in a long anticipated resolution of a cadence and was a perfect close to a successful concert mainly energised by who knows what following a night in Bruges. </p> [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"444\" caption=\"Nick Fletcher leads the Orchestra in Brugge.\"] [/caption] Our next concert was just a walk away from the hostel in Bruges (no need for badly driven buses that day) in a beautiful Catholic Church called Onze Lieve Vrouwekerk (Dutch: Church of Our Lady). However, being a Sunday we were unable to play Tchaikovky’s 1812 Overture as it was written to commemorate Russia's defense of Moscow against Napoleon's advancing Grande Armée at the Battle of Borodino and therefore has influences from war. Instead Nick insisted we played Mussorgsky with no rehearsal which was surprisingly flawless considering we hadn’t played it for 3 days. </p> The last concert, this time in Amiens, France, was in Cathédrale Notre-Dame d'Amiens which reaches a height of 42.30 m and surely enough gave a challenging but impressive acoustic. Luckily we were allowed to play the 1812 and all held our breath as La Marseillaise, the French National anthem, filled the church; the audience didn’t seem to mind however, with one man insisting on giving a standing ovation at the end of every piece. So 10 days after we started, a lot of bleary eyes and unhealthy livers returned to Edinburgh leaving me with just one more thing to say… Happy holidays and see you in September for more buffoonery and of course music making! </p> <p style=\"text-align: right;\"> Cat Burch </p></p> "},{"title":"Freshers' Week 2011","url":"/blog/2011/freshers2011/","date":"2011-08-23 05:23:12 +0100","categories":["events","upcoming socials","society","fresher's week"],"body":"For our 2012 Freshers' Week Information, click here!

We have recently been helping the ENUO (European Network of University Orchestras) develop their network as a founding participant. This may also ease the organisation of tours to Europe in the future, probably meaning better repertoire and better venues. Read on to find out a bit more… ENUO (European Network of University Orchestras) was created by Uppsala University in late 2011 by Stefan Karpe with the goal to bring the organisation and the members of university orchestras in Europe together to exchange information and create opportunities for touring and exchange. The intention is to extend the idea of European citizenship by internationalising university music and encouraging students to play music together with students from other European countries, that have a different language and culture. By doing so there will be an exchange of culture and ideas as the students share a creative experience and learn from each other. Today there are already 93 orchestras in the network from 16 countries in the European Union. “University students within the European Community come from various cultures and they speak many different languages. But when students from various cultures are playing different musical instruments together, as in a symphony orchestra, they communicate with each other through one language called music.” — Stefan Karpe, Director Musices Royal Academic Orchestra, Uppsala University The network will help the orchestras to contact each other more easily, so they can exchange information and tips and help each other with touring and sheet music. It will also be easier for orchestras to initiate musical collaborations within the network. Also the individual members of the orchestras will benefit through the network. They can join the project orchestra and other activities of ENUO to make music with students from other studies, universities and countries. They are also encouraged to study abroad and join an orchestra in one of the universities in the network. ENUO should function as a kind of social network for them. Most of these goals will be achieved with the help of ENUO’s website ( www.enuo.eu ) which will be launched on the 22nd February 2012 . “There has long been a need for a common platform for European university orchestras. The network will help to highlight the opportunities for exchange students to keep playing in an orchestra and to share experiences and knowledge among the orchestras.” — Kasper Teglgaard Koch, Chairman of SymfUni, University of Copenhagen Symphony Orchestra “The Manchester University Music Society’s orchestras are joining the ENUO because we think it is a fantastic opportunity to broaden our music-making experiences. Whether it’s organizing events locally or international tours, we hope that ENUO can provide support for us, and we look forward to helping the other member orchestras in their own endeavours. We hope that ENUO becomes a strong, robust network that strengthens music making in Universities across Europe.” — Seb Huckle, President of the Manchester University Music Society "},{"title":"EUMS Chorus: Spring Concert 2012","url":"/blog/2012/spring-chorus/","date":"2012-02-12 00:00:00 +0000","categories":[],"body":" Following on from last year’s sold out performance of “Dream of Gerontius”, this Spring, Chorus are showcasing pieces that represent a selection of the finest British Choral works.

At the helm is their new conductor Michael Graham. I thought I would catch up with him. So Michael, Sinfonia have been rehearsing for their upcoming Spring Concert for a few weeks now. How is it going? Riding on the high of our Winter concert of Nielsen and Sibelius, Sinfonia’s new programme is progressing nicely. The music not as intensive as it was last semester and certainly the message that I’m getting from the ensemble is that it is fun to play. That is the most important thing! For an orchestra, approaching new pieces is always a challenge, especially if there is unfamiliarity with the work (or even the composer!). I always try and put a little bit of something interesting and unusual into a programme – to keep both the orchestra and the audience interested. The pieces being performed this evening are all quite well known and have been recorded by many conductors and orchestras – do you listen to these recordings and do they influence your interpretation? I try to listen to as many recordings as possible of each work, and I may like what I hear, but the main challenge of conducting is to conceive your own interpretation. You may think you know a piece of work of by heart (take Nimrod or the Pomp and Circumstance Marches for instance), yet you do not really appreciate, nor truly understand a work until you start studying a score. Different things pop out at you and you discover secret corners of the work that are sometimes masked in a recording. Recordings do influence decisions yes, but primarily I try to form my own ideas. What is it you are looking forward to most this EUMS Spring Concert Series? Sinfonia’s concert aside, I’m probably looking forward to EUMS Symphony Orchestra’s Tchaikovsky Symphony No. 6 “Pathétique”. Tchaikovsky is one of my favourite composers and his final symphony is one of the biggest emotional journeys that orchestra, conductor and listener can take. The unbridled gaiety that we typically relate to Tchaikovsky is confined to the third movement while the fourth movement finale is a slow, emotive descent into the basses. It’s very difficult for performers to conserve enough stamina and passion to feel involved with this movement, especially after the energy demanded by the previous. Last winter’s Sinfonia concert was received very well. Did you enjoy conducting your first performance? Interesting question – it was my first experience of being in the driving seat for a whole concert. In the past I have co-conducted (and sub-conducted) under the guidance of a more experienced musician: Nigel Osbourne of EU Composers’ Orchestra or my conducting teacher, Chris Swaffer. It is a fascinating experience working in rehearsals and then the performance. Something different comes over people when they perform, something that if harnessed can help project the good qualities of the music. You are a busy conductor these days. How does conducting Sinfonia compare to your other engagements? Sinfonia is the biggest orchestra in my regular commitments. It is also the only one that I suppose plays “mainstream” repertoire. I’m currently Assistant Conductor of EU Composers’ Orchestra. We play compositions by student composers studying here at the University, record new works and generally embracing contemporary music in all its forms. I like being involved with this orchestra as it is working with fellow musicians, also enthusiastic about the unusual. As a musician, Composers’ Orchestra has been very important to my development. As a conductor, it presents new challenges addressing rehearsal, orchestration, music philosophy and even conducting technique itself. The other group I work with is the Edinburgh Branch of the Society of Recorder Players. They are an adult amateur group who play a wide variety of music. Rehearsals are generally more relaxed and I share the task of conducting with ensemble members and another music student. Did you start with an ambition to be a conductor, or did you start as a musician and then move into conducting? I suppose conducting has always been an element of my studies. I went to a lot of concerts during my teenage years and I soon learnt about the role and requirements of the conductor. Of course to conduct, you need musical training and proficiency and I was soon taking lessons in signing, clarinet, piano and organ. I’m still a relative newcomer to music, starting when I was thirteen (I’m 21 now – not even 10 years reading music!). However conducting is actually only part of a musician’s training, even if some of us seek careers in the discipline. Every musician should give it a go! Did you come from a musical family? No. I was the first in my family to even take learning a musical instrument seriously. However, my parents can hardly be called philistines: My mum trained as an actress at the RSAMD and has performed widely on stage, television, film and radio. My dad studied fine art and sculpture at Edinburgh College of Art. I suppose music might have been a logical move coming from such a creative family. In rehearsals you seem confident and at ease. Do you get nervous before a performance? It depends. If I’m playing a solo recital on piano or clarinet, I will get nervous. You are very exposed. With conducting, you are facing a group of people that you have been closely working with over some time and are not alone on stage. I’m not saying I wasn’t nervous before Sinfonia’s Winter Concert, but psychologically it does help when you are alone off-stage, waiting for your entry that all that is waiting for you is a whole load of friendly faces. Sinfonia has a legacy of providing talented young musicians within the University of Edinburgh an opportunity to perform concertos with a full orchestra. How important do you feel it is that Sinfonia continues this legacy into the future? Very important. It can help boost a music student’s experience. Even if that performer isn’t a music student it provides stimulus and a unique opportunity to indulge in their hobby. Daniel Kraemer is the soloist for this spring’s performance of Saint-Saëns’ Cello Concerto No. 1. What are the most important things to focus on when working with a soloist? Apart from the obvious “get it right”, I think that the most important dimension to a concert is the blend in personality between the soloist and orchestra. This is where the true emotional dynamic is to the live performance. Personalities that complement each other can sometimes make or break the performance. It’s best to think of the concerto as a conversation between two people. Sometimes these people agree, sometimes they don’t… Demand for orchestral conductors in and around Edinburgh seems to be high at the moment. Where do you hope conducting will take you in the coming years? At the moment, I am aiming for further study, hopefully in conducting. Important attributes of a conductor are experience and personality. For the foreseeable future, getting as much experience within music as possible is my short term goal. Beyond that – who can say…? Saturday mornings are not everyone’s cup of tea… Have you managed to get used to the early rise, or do you take morning rehearsals in your stride? All of Sinfonia know I need a coffee before an “Allegro”… Sinfonia’s Spring concert is on Saturday 24th March in the Reid Concert Hall. For more details go to the concert page here .

Continuing on from the success of several years of the project running, over 420 pupils from seven schools will be attending the event at the Reid Concert Hall. The purpose of the day is to introduce the children to the world of orchestral and choral music, showcasing different sections of the orchestra and choir through arrangements of music that will be familiar to them, and music that will excite and impress (but not intimidate) them. There will be lots of participation opportunities for them too. We ran a very successful day last year and are very much looking forward to sharing the experience again using knowledge gained from previous events to make it an even more enjoyable and educational afternoon. This is a rare opportunity for most children, and we are looking to encourage a fresh look on classical music and musicians through example: demonstrating our passion and enthusiasm for what we do. We also hope to show the variety of people we have in our society (not just music students) to promote music as a fun and beneficial activity as well as a profession. With the government’s current run of spending reviews, schools are feeling the pinch and the number of hours of music-based education has taken one of the biggest hits. Through our education projects we are able to give a large number of children the chance to experience a large orchestra and chorus whilst offering them a learning experience that they would otherwise miss out on. This event will be running on the 21st March 2012.

Russell Cowieson looks back at the development of a true vintage that will stay with EUMS long into the future… Harvest All great vintages need a quality harvest, which is why our annual auditions are so vitally important. As usual with auditions I worried about getting the quality needed but in the end my overriding emotion was one of gratitude that so many fine musicians performed for Michael and I, leaving me confident that we had the potential for a great orchestra. Blend An orchestra is such a wonderful blend of instruments and personalities. This is, of course, one of the great joys and challenges of playing in, and working with, an orchestra. The other very important part of the blend is the choice of composer and for first semester we had set ourselves the challenge of adding Elgar to the mix (along with a couple of hundred singers and soloists!) First Tasting Rehearsing Gerontius presented many difficulties. Early rehearsals were tricky; it’s so difficult for performers to understand how the jigsaw of a piece fits together when many important pieces of the puzzle (chorus and soloists) are missing. I try to never forget the great privilege of having the whole score in front of me and it was to the orchestra’s credit that they trusted me repeatedly when I reassured them that their playing was shaping up well and that all would be transformed with the addition of the ‘missing parts’. We also had the challenge of reversing the orchestra’s usual seating plan to accommodate chorus, which the orchestra did with great humour. Of course, the beauty of the music played its part in sweeping us along. We had a long but necessary rehearsal on the day, which settled everybody in for what was to be a really memorable, sell out, performance. Huge gratitude and respect to Neil for the many hours of preparation shaping the chorus towards such high quality. I later found out that there had been several emergencies in the lead up to the concert and it is to the committee’s great credit that they dealt with these in a quiet and efficient manner, allowing Neil and I to focus on music matters. The Vintage Improves For second semester I could now look forward to allowing the orchestra to ‘flex their muscle’ on full blooded orchestral repertoire. The Wagner, in rehearsals, never quite ‘floated’ or achieved the sense of space and time which I felt the music needed. I shouldn’t have worried; the performance was beautiful and set a high benchmark. The Rodrigo gave us a chance to showcase the talents of our wind and brass players who gave a stunning performance. During the interval, I remember thinking that we had achieved perhaps our finest opening to a concert and hoped that our focus would remain for the Tchaikovsky. I wasn’t let down. We had invested so much time in rehearsals and were rewarded with a high degree of professional focus and commitment but also a great sense of freedom and collaborative music making. As a conductor you are often called on to ‘manage’ situations live on stage, but here I simply found myself immersed in an emotional performance which was undoubtedly a personal highlight. Final Tasting The word is out! We have created a great blend. Will it turn out to be a great vintage? I think so. With Sibelius’s wonderful 5th Symphony to look forward to in our summer concert, final tasting will surely confirm the 2012 vintage one to savour for many years to come. EUMS Symphony Orchestra will return on the 18th May 2012 for the EUMS Summer Concert .

Neil Metcalfe reflects on his experiences with Chorus… My love affair with Chorus began in 1984 as a Fresher. It was Christopher Bell’s first season as conductor of both Chorus and Symphony Orchestra. He’d chosen an incredibly difficult piece of repertoire – Walton’s Belshazzar’s Feast . We thought we’d never get it learned – most of us had never even heard music like it at that stage in our lives. I never imagined that, 28 years later, I’d be in front of the chorus as its conductor. But then, Chorus (and EUMS generally) is full of surprises… Belshazzar led to Verdi’s Requiem and then, in the year I had the honour of being president, we put on a performance (possibly only the second ever Scottish performance) of Britten’s War Requiem . Scored for symphony and chamber orchestras, SATB chorus and a boys’ choir, this again was incredibly ambitious. We took the decision to hire the Usher Hall and filled it to capacity… This is what EUMS does best! So, my first experiences of EUMS very much drive my present enthusiasm (and somewhat ‘paternal’ feelings) for all that we strive to achieve. I know my time in EUMS in those formative years of my career has played a major part in shaping my life (personally and professionally), and it’s an absolute honour and privilege to stand in front of the Chorus week by week and hear yet another major piece of choral repertoire rise from its sleeping bed and take shape in the mouths of those who now make up its numbers. Reflecting on the past three years, I’m bowled over by a number of things; the sheer number of people who turn out to sing each week, the difficulty of some of the repertoire which we manage to conquer, the enthusiasm which is shown for all that we do, the sheer will and determination of the committee to put these amazing concerts on, and the healthy state of singing generally in the University. All things come to an end, and when the time comes (although I hope that this isn’t for some time yet!), my biggest wish is that one of the future conductors of the Chorus is presently in our midst, being inspired to take up the baton (literally and metaphorically) later in life. Chorus will return in EUMS’ Summer Concert .

This year the role is being filled by Michael Sawaryn, a friendly member of Symphony Orchestra known for his mother’s highly sought after and delicious charity brownies. Last year the society put on multiple concerts in a variety of venues, organised a highly successful charity event in the form of the Big Sing and engaged with over 400 primary school pupils in our annual Spring Education Project. This was completed exlusively from the subscription fees of our own performing members and Gold members . In order to ensure that we are performing in the best available venues and are able to attain the most exciting and high quality music, we often need to take part in additional fundraising activities. These have usually existed as bake sales around the university campus or during the intervals of our concerts and are vital in allowing us to fund bigger and better concerts. It is often difficult for busy committee members to run such fundraising efforts on their own. Also, in order to expand our scope and to allow us to better fulfil our mission , we always seek to attain additional corporate sponsorship. In order to take control of this, and to manage our incoming finances alongside our Treasurer the Fundraising and Sponsorship Manager will seek to gain the support of local and national businesses who wish to align themselves with positive action in the wider community. If you have any queries regarding how the society makes or spends its money, or wish to discuss opportunities surrounding sponsorship, please contact Michael at fundraising@eums.org.uk .

You have checked out the EUSA website . You have found your way here. But why? What on earth is the Edinburgh University Music Society? Hopefully this page can help to explain who we are and why you should get involved with us. The Society We have been making music since 1867, and as the first (and best) student music society in Scotland we have had a proud position within the musical heritage of Edinburgh, Scotland and indeed the world. We are also the largest society in the University of Edinburgh, and as a result we are able to put on bigger and better events for our members and the community. Our mission is to bring music to the wider community, and we achieve this through regular concerts, working with charities, organising education projects and liaising with other musical organisations, ensuring we do our best to make classical music easily accessible to all. The society itself is made up of around 320 members in three classical ensembles: Chorus , Sinfonia , and Symphony Orchestra . Making Music First and foremost you become a member of EUMS to make music. Our standard of performance is as close to professional as you can get, and if you don’t believe us then listen to our recent recordings of Tchaikovsky’s Sixth Symphony or Rossini’s Petite Messe Solenelle on Last.fm. We have recorded with the BBC, and way back in the 1960s premièred Carl Orff’s Carmina Burana in Scotland. Our recent performances of Elgar’s Dream of Gerontius and Saint-Saëns’ Cello Concerto No. 1 have garnered widespread acclaim. These performances occur as a result of the passion for music of our members, most drawn from our influx of freshers year on year. We have three outstanding conductors who have consistently proven themselves capable of bringing the best out of our members, and thanks to them each concert takes the society to new places and brings new delights. You don’t need to be the next Benedetti to play with us either: our Chorus is non-auditioned meaning anyone of any ability can join, and Sinfonia do not audition for their string players. We perform six concerts in three concert series: our Winter concerts showcase each ensemble; our Spring concerts join one of our orchestras and Chorus for what is always a breathtakingly epic performance alongside another concert from the remaining orchestra; our Summer concert, with all three ensembles performing together under the one roof. Other concerts also take place during the course of the year, including on tour and as part of our community work. Working Hard, Playing Harder As you will find out, our passion for music making is at least matched by our love of having a good time: from ceilidhs to karaoke and from defeating our rival societies at hockey to our regular evening pub meetings, we do like to let our hair down, and our members will always be delighted by a new face in the mix. We have all been new to the society at some point! Major features of the EUMS social calendar include sectional meals, tutti weekend, carolling, intramural hockey (we can definitely beat our season’s best of second place this year!), pre-tour (voice destroying) karaoke, mass exodus-like goings to RSNO or SCO concerts and the highlight of the year: The Musoc Ball (a posh meal, giant ceilidh and society-wide party). Our Community As part of our enthusiasm for making music, we spend the whole year getting stuck in with events across the community outside the University of Edinburgh. Every year we have expanded our education projects with local schools, and last year we entertained over 400 pupils in our main Spring event, teaching them about classical music whilst keeping them grinning. We also have a long record of helping local charities, and as part of this continuing tradition we will be working with Bethany Christian Trust once more as part of The Big Sing 2012 . Last year the event was well attended and raised over £1300 for the charity’s Stop Homelessness campaign. Tour For most of our members, past and present, the highlight of their years in the society is tour. Every year we grab our instruments, vocal chords and a couple of pairs of knickers (optional) and head off towards the horizon. Recent tours have explored locations as exotic as France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, and North Wales! This year we are looking set to travel to the continent once more, though where remains a secret… for now! Tour is the time to really get to know other members, whilst getting the chance to perform in some spectacular venues. Amiens Cathedral has to be a highlight of recent years, with our performance reducing audience members to tears (as we tried not to well up ourselves). Everyone gets to know everyone, and the memories will remain with you as highlights of your university career.

We will be playing a selection of some of the most memorable and intrinsically Russian classical music, starting with Glinka, who is acknowledged as the father of Russian nationalism in music with his famous Ruslan and Lyudmila Overture . We then move on to the Capriccio Italien , by Tchaikovsky, who was highly influenced by Glinka, claiming that “as the whole oak is in the acorn”, so had all of Russian music sprung from him. The main work in our repertoire is also by Tchaikovsky, with his epic Symphony No.2 , or the “Little Russian” symphony. Based on Ukrainian folksong, this is Russian nationalist music in its prime, with unforgettable melodies, magnificent chords and an undeniably Russian spirit, rounding off a concert that is not to be missed… Doors open at 7pm, and it is recommended that you arrive early to ensure that you are not disappointed!

The orchestra, under the inspirational baton of Russell Cowieson, will be collaborating with baritone Douglas Nairne in Mahler’s Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen . Mahler composed this song cycle following an unhappy love affair with the soprano Johanna Richter. In a letter to a friend, telling of his heart break, he writes, “The songs are a sequence in which a wayfaring craftsman, who has had a great sorrow, goes out into the world and wanders aimlessly”. The cycle consists of four songs which Mahler also wrote the words for. The melodies are reckless and shocked audiences at the time, “he soars and swoops, shedding dignity for raw pain, attacking loneliness, poverty and death”. The orchestra will conclude the programme with Mahler’s Symphony No. 1 . Often considered one of the greatest symphonies composed, Mahler began writing it when he was 29 years old. He incorporates many of the melodies from the song cycle and ultimately produces a work that depicts the uneasiness of his difficult childhood and the beauty of the landscape of the Austrian countryside. “This symphonic composition is the work of a young, unbridled and untameable talent, which must forcibly stem the flood of melodic motifs pressing forth from it, which breaks through the framework of all conventional forms and seeks to create something new…a storm of applause broke out at the end of every movement of his work.” These inspiring works mixed with the enthusiasm of the orchestra, look to produce an spectacular evening… Doors open at 7pm, and it is recommended that you arrive early to ensure that you are not disappointed!

So what better way to celebrate our national Saint than to come along to St. Cuthbert’s Parish Church to hear music from the Auld Alliance? Our repertoire for the evening includes one of Poulenc’s most celebrated works. His Gloria is a setting of the Roman Catholic Gloria in Excelsis Deo and includes a fine soprano solo by Amy Strachan, a third year music student at the University of Edinburgh. Joining our French line-up will be Faure’s Cantique de Jean Racine which was written when the composer was only nineteen years old. Returning to home soil, we sing John Gardner’s A Burns Sequence which was first performed by the British Federation of Youth Choirs and the Scottish Chamber Orchestra in Glasgow in 1995, conducted by ex-EUMS member and conductor Christopher Bell. This sequence sets out some of the varied activities of Burns’ life. His religious convictions, his love of setting new words to traditional melodies, his delight in romantic love (and philandering), and his use of English as well as the Lallans are all included, showing Burns - the highly cultured man who did not forget his lowly origin. We will also sing Ken Johnston’s Now is the Time of Peace. This moving work was written as a commemorative for Scotland’s Holocaust Memorial Day. The text is a plea for hope and peace, and that all fear be past. What better way to end the long month of November than by coming along to the EUMS Chorus’ Winter Concert?

Far be it from us to harp on about how much we loved performing it, The Student ’s Rebecca O’Doherty gave us a shining review following the concert. Read it in full below: “Friday 23rd November 2012 saw the Edinburgh University Music Society’s Symphony Orchestra bring the music of Gustav Mahler to Greyfriars Kirk, Edinburgh. Following the major success of their programmes last year including performances of Tchaikovsky’s Sixth Symphony , Symphony No. 5 by Sibelius and Elgar’s Dream of Gerontius (with EUMS Chorus) , the orchestra produced an even more ambitious programme of Mahler’s Songs of a Wayfarer featuring solo baritone Douglas Nairne, which were simply stunning, and the incredible Symphony No. 1 under the baton of conductor, Russell Cowieson .” “The thought of an entire concert of Mahler may have caused some apprehension but Gustav himself had originally intended the two works to be performed side by side and at the concert this proved to be a success. “ Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen (Songs of a Wayfarer) was executed beautifully by both the orchestra and soloist. The orchestra were very aware of the soloist’s intimate singing style and their respectful playing added to this element of intimacy which made the experience of this work emotive and haunting with particular praise to the string section and soloists. Highlights were the third and final song. “The concert’s second half was Mahler’s Symphony No. 1 . Despite being an ambitious choice for a university orchestra, they handled the difficulties well. The third movement was a particular highlight with the fantastic woodwind soloists getting into character and providing an impressive display of their talents. The energetic finale showed that EUMS Symphony Orchestra have an exciting year ahead of them with a group of dedicated players, great management and an inspirational conductor.” With an inspiring programme of Brahms and Macmillan , Symphony Orchestra are performing in EUMS’s Spring Concert Series on the 22nd March.

For this project, we aim to introduce school children to the world and sounds of the orchestra and choir. We had Beyoncé, Olly Murs and even Avicii songs arranged for orchestra by some of our very own members and alumni - special thanks to Tim Cais, Vicky Carmichael, Olivia Goodman and Sam Williams for these. And at the front, leading each workshop was myself rather nervously wondering if everything would go to plan and the sessions would be fun for everyone involved. As it turned out, I worried needlessly as you really can’t go too wrong allowing the children to hit a bass drum as loud as they can and conduct an entire orchestra as fast or as slowly as they wanted! We listened to the instruments individually and spoke about how each one was made, its place in the orchestra and what sort of sounds it can make - this brought a lot of laughter when the trombone was demonstrating a glissando! It was great to see both the musicians and children enjoying making music together and will hopefully have encouraged musicians of the future. Thank you to all members who took part and thank you to the children who got involved so enthusiastically!” Julie Aitken - Community Outreach Manager “I had a great time at the education project! It was really nice to play something else other than classical music again, and the reactions from the children when they heard what we were going to play were just fantastic! Its really good to see kids interested in music, and especially the trombone… Who doesn’t want to hear glissandos?! Hope to maybe see some of them playing in the orchestra in years to come…?” Jamie MacDonald - Trombone “I really enjoyed playing in this year’s education project. I loved playing the fun orchestral arrangement of songs the kids would know, and it was really great to see them sing along and have a really fun time too. The kids loved getting involved by trying out all the different percussion instruments, and having a go at conducting. This was a fun filled day which has hopefully inspired the future generation of musicians to get involved with music.” Katy Cavanagh - Oboe "},{"title":"EUMS Sinfonia Winter Concert","url":"/blog/2013/eums-sinfonia-winter-concert/","date":"2013-11-04 00:00:00 +0000","categories":[],"body":" Come along to a wonderful night of music from Edinburgh University Music Society’s Sinfonia.

Can you tell us a bit about yourself and your background as a ‘cellist before you came to Edinburgh? Well, where do I start? I’ve been playing since I was small. I started in primary school – just had a teacher right up until I was 17 and was in various orchestras in the “burgh” [not our burgh] and a few little things here and there and the last thing that I was in before EUMS was the LSSO [ooooh fancy] . So I hear there’s a lot of gossip in Symphony Orchestra, what’s the biggest kept secret in the ‘cello section? Oooooo, I don’t know if it’s a good thing if I say this… Well I suppose half of us don’t practice [that’s boring Patrick, tell us some juicy gossip] …Well you know everyone’s had a go at each other at some point and I hear there might be some juiciness with a certain 3rd desk ‘cellist… but I better not go there… You’ve got to watch out for us at the socials… you don’t know what we’re going to get up to…especially when the lager starts flowing! It’s apparently a musician thing but everyone has a name for their instrument. What is your beautiful ‘cello called? My current ‘cello doesn’t have a name, but I called my first one Oliver. [So we need to start a campaign to name Patrick’s ‘cello?] Well I’ll just call him Gregory (it’s my middle name). What other music do you take part in, in Edinburgh? I’m part of a band, we play funk and sort of hiphop stuff… but I play bass guitar in that’s not ‘cello. If you could play any other music in the orchestra what would it be? Trumpet…my brother plays, but it’s something you can play anywhere and everyone loves the trumpet [we at EUMS don’t know about that but each to his own!] What has been you most memorable EUMS experience so far? Oh definitely VERDI… 100%… yeah. It was brilliant and playing in the massive venue which is the McEwan Hall and everyone really together in a great performance. It was awesome. If you could swap roles with Russell for one rehearsal what would you like to conduct? Something ‘cello-y, [have we just created a new word?] I guess, like a concerto or something like a ‘cello concerto, because like I play the ‘cello [we didn’t realise you play the ‘cello Patrick, how fantastic!] So what’s your favourite ‘cello concerto? I’d say Dvorak’s ‘cello concerto because we did it in my orchestra years ago and we went to Prague and played it. EUMS Symphony is currently working towards a big concert in our spring series. Where and when is it and what are you playing? It’s ummmm the 14th March at ehhhh Greyfriar’s [long pause] Kirk… we are playing Tchaik 4, ehhhh some Wagner and some Canteloube… [what’s the Wagner you’re playing Patrick?] ehhh, I can’t remember even though we played it about 30 seconds ago!

When I lived in the UK still, when I was about 11, I played in school orchestras and concert bands. Nothing that fancy really, that was my taster for it all! Then I moved to Finland and started playing in a wind orchestra, that’s where I stuck but I had a little dabble in a university orchestra when I was 16, and everyone else was 25! [EUMS wonder if they are as sociable as us!] I played piano for a long time before trombone though too! What has been your most memorable moment of your EUMS membership so far? That’s a tough one but it will have to be sectional meals with Das Mute, when I had to drink a whole trombone mute of beer in one. So what we all want to know is, did you succeed? Almost, almost! I will succeed next year, I promise you all. [EUMS is going to hold him to that one] You are president Vicky’s chosen fresher. How does this feel? It’s quite scary in some respects actually. She likes to have a lot of power over me and I’m trying hard to kind of distance myself from her. But otherwise it has been fun, there have been benefits [I wonder what these benefits are? President Vicky has kept them VERY quiet] and how are you living up to the task? I suppose you’ll have to ask her that, I can’t be telling… You are a committed member of our hockey team, what’s the biggest kept secret on the Peffermill pitch on a cold Friday night? Ummm, I think it’s ummmm, ehhh. It’s not really a secret anymore but Kevin Hanley is our biggest secret with his one handed skills. I think it’s basically how we are going to win all the rest of our games this year. Who did you have your eyes on at the EUMS Ball? Those dance moves must have won you some attention? I was asked to go with several people. Sadly I had to disappoint a lot of them. There is nobody really just now. [EUMS GIRLS, get in there quick before he is snapped up] If you could play another instrument what would it be? If it was orchestral it would be the trumpet, anything else it would be tenor sax. Patrick said trumpet in our last interview as well, what’s so special about the trumpet? I think it’s because I’ve been playing trombone which is nice, but the trumpet has all the interesting parts and bits that everyone can hear. It would be nice to be heard a bit more. [Don’t cry Jamie…I think he’s feeling a bit bitter—Trombone concerto for next Sinfonia concert?] What has been your best Sinfonia moment so far? Playing Finlandia by Sibelius in the first concert I played in because it reminded me of home and went very well! [Tears are most definitely now falling! It’s all too emotional. Someone pass me the tissues.] You are playing some interesting repertoire this semester with Sinfonia. Where and when is the concert and most importantly what are you playing? Ehhh, it’s in March sometime [Correct] . I have no idea when. Where? I presume it’s here in the Reid [Correct! Nearly there Jamie] . What? Something by Wagner which I don’t know the name of… Schumann 4 and the Beethoven but I’m not playing in that. [At last, we got there—well just about!] Any final words for EUMS? I don’t really think so. I’ll think of something later.

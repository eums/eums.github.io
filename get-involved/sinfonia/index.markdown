<h1 style="text-align: justify;">EUMS Sinfonia<&#47;h1><br />
<img class="size-full wp-image-620" alt="" src="http:&#47;&#47;eums.eusa.ed.ac.uk&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;images&#47;w620&#47;sinfonia04.jpg" width="620" height="250" &#47;></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Edinburgh University Music Society&rsquo;s Sinfonia is a semi-auditioned full symphony&nbsp;<&#47;strong><strong>orchestra that rehearses every Saturday morning from 10.30 am to 1.30 pm in the Reid&nbsp;<&#47;strong><strong>Concert Hall, Bristo Square under the baton of Peter Keenan.<&#47;strong><&#47;h2><br />
The orchestra aims to provide an opportunity for keen string players to get a chance to&nbsp;rehearse and perform with a full scale orchestra without the stress of auditions, whilst also&nbsp;trying to create enough of a challenge for the auditioned woodwind, brass and percussion&nbsp;sections. Auditions take place during Freshers Week at the beginning of every academic&nbsp;year and involve performing a previously selected piece of music as well as some sight&nbsp;reading. All string players are welcome to join the orchestra without auditioning, although we expect a&nbsp;standard of at least ABRSM grade 6 (grade 8 is ideal) to cope with the challenging&nbsp;repertoire. Exempting special circumstances, we expect attendance at all rehearsals.</p>
<p>Like the society&rsquo;s other ensembles, Sinfonia holds a concert towards the end of every term&nbsp;in venues such as the Reid Concert Hall, Greyfriars Kirk and St Mary&rsquo;s Cathedral. Recent&nbsp;concerts have included performances of challenging works such as Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s Symphony&nbsp;No. 2 and Capriccio Italien, Pomp and Circumstance Marches by Elgar and Sibelius&nbsp;Symphony No. 3.</p>
<p>Every other year, the orchestra joins forces with the society&rsquo;s Chorus to perform a large&nbsp;scale orchestral and choral piece. Last year such a collaboration took place with the two&nbsp;ensembles delivering a superb performance of Mendelssohn&rsquo;s Symphony No. 2 &ldquo;Lobgesang&rdquo;&nbsp;in St. Mary&rsquo;s Cathedral on Palmerston Place. Sinfonia further serves as a platform for&nbsp;talented student soloists to perform with a full orchestra. Recently this has included a highly&nbsp;acclaimed performance of Saint-Saen&rsquo;s Cello Concerto No. 1.</p>

<p>Last but not least, Sinfonia has a lot to offer from a social perspective too. Social activities&nbsp;include lunch in Teviot after every rehearsal, as well as sectional meals and other events&nbsp;with the whole of the society.</p>

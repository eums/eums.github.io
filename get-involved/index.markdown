## Get involved

Whether you're a seasoned musician or have no musical training, whether you're a student or not, we'd love for you to get involved with us!

### Making music

The society consists of three ensembles. The largest is [Chorus](/chorus/), a non-auditioned choir of more than 100 people, which rehearses on Tuesday evenings in Paterson's Land.

[Sinfonia](/sinfonia/) is an auditioned orchestra (apart from the string section, which is non-auditioning). Rehearsals are at the Reid Hall on Saturday mornings.

The [Symphony Orchestra](/symphony-orchestra/) is a large auditioning orchestra of a very high standard. It is conducted by Russell Cowieson. Rehearsals are on Monday evenings in the Reid Hall.

Each ensemble performs 3 times each year, in a total of 6 concerts. In particular, we join Chorus and one of our orchestras for what is always a breathtakingly epic performance in either the Winter or Spring concert series.  The Summer concert features all three ensembles performing together under one roof.

### Socials

As you will find out, our passion for music making is at least matched by our love of having a good time: from ceilidhs to karaoke and from defeating our rival societies at hockey to our regular evening pub meetings, we do like to let our hair down, and our members will always be delighted by a new face in the mix. We have all been new to the society at some point!

Major features of the EUMS social calendar include sectional meals, tutti weekend, carolling, intramural hockey (we can definitely beat our season’s best of second place this year!), pre-tour karaoke, mass outings to RSNO or SCO concerts, and the highlight of the year: The Musoc Ball (a meal, giant ceilidh and society-wide party).

### Community engagement

As part of our enthusiasm for making music, we spend the whole year getting stuck in with events across the community outside the University of Edinburgh.  Every year we have expanded our education projects with local schools, and last year we entertained over 400 pupils in our main Spring event, teaching them about classical music whilst keeping them grinning.

We also have a long record of helping local charities, and as part of this continuing tradition we will be working with [Bethany Christian Trust](http://www.bethanychristiantrust.com/) once more as part of [The Big Sing 2012](/blog/2012/big-sing/).

In 2011, the event was well attended and raised over **£1300** for the charity’s Stop Homelessness campaign.

### Tours

For most of our members, past and present, the highlight of their years in the society is tour. Every year we grab our instruments and vocal chords and head off towards the horizon. Recent tours have explored locations as exotic as Norway, Spain, North Wales, Germany, and Northern Ireland!

Tour is the time to really get to know other members, whilst getting the chance to perform in some spectacular venues. Amiens Cathedral has to be a highlight of recent years, with our performance reducing audience members to tears (as we tried not to well up ourselves). Everyone gets to know everyone, and the memories will remain with you as highlights of your university career.

## Get involved

The Edinburgh University Music Society has a membership running well into the
300s, and thanks to commitment being fuelled by a desire to be involved and a
passion for music rather than a mandatory requirement to attend, the quality of
our performances is very high. Our concerts often sell out, and thanks to our
dedicated members are always a great success.

### Ensembles

The society consists of three ensembles. The largest is **Chorus**, a choir of
around 200 people. It is totally non-auditioned&mdash;you don't even need to be
able to read music. [Find out more about Chorus](/chorus/).

**Sinfonia**, an orchestra conducted by Peter Keenan, consists of auditioned
players apart from the string section which is non-auditioning. They rehearse
at the Reid Hall on a Saturday morning. [Find out more about
Sinfonia](/sinfonia/).

The **Symphony Orchestra**, a large auditioning orchestra of a very high
standard, conducted by Russell Cowieson, rehearse on a Monday evening in the
Reid Hall. [Find out more about Symphony Orchestra](/symphony-orchestra/).

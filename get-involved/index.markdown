## Get involved

We have been making music since 1867, and as the first (and best) student music
society in Scotland we have had a proud position within the musical heritage of
Edinburgh and indeed Scotland. We are also the largest society in the
University of Edinburgh, and as such, we are able to put on bigger and better
events.

Whether you're a seasoned musician or have no musical training, whether you're
a student or not, we'd love for you to get involved with us!

### Making music

The society consists of three ensembles. The largest is [Chorus](/chorus/), a
choir of around 200 people, which rehearses on Tuesday evenings in Paterson's
Land. It is totally non-auditioned&mdash;you don't even need to be able to read
music.

[Sinfonia](/sinfonia/) is an auditioned orchestra (apart from the string
section, which is non-auditioning). They rehearse at the Reid Hall on Saturday
mornings.

The [Symphony Orchestra](/symphony-orchestra/) is a large auditioning orchestra
of a very high standard. It is conducted by Russell Cowieson. Rehearsals are on
Monday evenings in the Reid Hall.

We perform six concerts in three concert series: our Winter concerts showcase
each ensemble, our Spring concerts join one of our orchestras and Chorus for
what is always a breathtakingly epic performance alongside another concert from
the remaining orchestra, and our Summer concert features all three ensembles
performing together under the one roof.

### Socials

As you will find out, our passion for music making is at least matched by our
love of having a good time: from ceilidhs to karaoke and from defeating our
rival societies at hockey to our regular evening pub meetings, we do like to
let our hair down, and our members will always be delighted by a new face in
the mix. We have all been new to the society at some point!

Major features of the EUMS social calendar include sectional meals, tutti
weekend, carolling, intramural hockey (we can definitely beat our season’s best
of second place this year!), pre-tour karaoke, mass outings to RSNO or SCO
concerts, and the highlight of the year: The Musoc Ball (a meal, giant ceilidh
and society-wide party).

### Community engagement

As part of our enthusiasm for making music, we spend the whole year getting
stuck in with events across the community outside the University of Edinburgh.
Every year we have expanded our education projects with local schools, and last
year we entertained over 400 pupils in our main Spring event, teaching them
about classical music whilst keeping them grinning.

We also have a long record of helping local charities, and as part of this
continuing tradition we will be working with [Bethany Christian Trust](http://www.bethanychristiantrust.com/)
once more as part of [The Big Sing 2012](/blog/2012/big-sing/).

In 2011, the event was well attended and raised over £1300 for the charity’s
Stop Homelessness campaign.

## Get involved

The Edinburgh University Music Society has a membership running well into the
300s, and thanks to commitment being fuelled by a desire to be involved and a
passion for music rather than a mandatory requirement to attend, the quality of
our performances is very high. Our concerts often sell out, and thanks to our
dedicated members are always a great success.

### Ensembles

The society consists of three ensembles. The largest is **Chorus**, a choir of
around 200 people. It is totally non-auditioned&mdash;you don't even need to be
able to read music.

<strong>Sinfonia</strong>, an orchestra conducted
by Peter Keenan, consists of auditioned players apart from the string section
which is non-auditioning. They rehearse at the Reid Hall on a Saturday morning.

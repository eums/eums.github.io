## Music library

Since our founding in 1867, we have collected a wide range of choral and instrumental music, including pieces written specifically for us by various composers. In 2012 EUMS transferred a large quantity of its collection to a number of other musical organisations on long-term loan; however, we still retain a large library of pieces, some unique.

Hiring music from our library costs a nominal rate of &pound;10/month per set
in addition to postage, with the cost being invoiced at the end of the agreed
hire period.

As part of our aim to increase the ease of provision to younger musicians,
**student and youth music groups will not incur these hire costs** and would
only pay for the postage of music.

For further details of the music we have on offer, and to make enquiries with
regards to the hire of a set of music, please contact our President at
[president@eums.org.uk](president@eums.org.uk).

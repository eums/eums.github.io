## About us

The Edinburgh University Music Society is a large (around 300 members) student
music organisation. Our aims are:

* to raise the profile of classical music in the university and in the wider
  community,
* to hold high-quality concerts throughout the year,
* to provide a welcoming and fun environment which can bring out the best in
  all of our members.

The society is a great way to meet all sorts of people. No matter what your
musical background, there is always a place for you within one of the
ensembles, allowing you to broaden your musical horizons as well as having a
great time along the way.

Whether you are an undergraduate, postgraduate or just someone who has heard
about what we do, all you have to do is come along and speak to one of our
dedicated committee members. [Find out more about getting
involved](/get-involved/).

The society also gets involved with the community, and plays an active role in
bringing music to the schools in and around Edinburgh. In recent years
interaction between the society and the community has increased a great deal,
and there are several annual events that take place involving local primary and
secondary schools and a number of our members, guiding them to create music and
learn new skills whilst also, of course, having fun.

The Edinburgh University Music Society strives to bring out the best in
everyone through the collision of talent and character, and in doing so present
the ability of the University to perform excellent music with versatility and
brilliance.

### History

The society was founded in 1867 by Sir Herbert Oakeley. Following the ancient
University's long musical tradition, which began formally in 1839 when the
origins of today's music department were founded as a result of a bequest from
General John Reid, the Music Society tied together many casual musical groups
that had existed previously.

Throughout the twentieth century the society took part in larger and more
extravagant performances, and this tradition has certainly not waned. Recent
performances include Elgar's *Dream of Gerontius* and Orff's *Carmina Burana*,
and with six major concerts a year the society's repertoire is extensive.

### The committee

The society is run by an elected group of sixteen members known as the
committee. These include our office bearers (the President, Secretary and
Treasurer), Ensemble Managers and Librarians, Publicity Managers, Social
Secretaries, Community Relations Manager, Tour Manager and our Fundraising and
Sponsorship Manager. Though the committee lead the organisation of the Society
and its events, all members are encouraged to get involved, and many of our
additional activities are organised by non-committee members.

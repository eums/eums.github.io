## About us

The Edinburgh University Music Society is a large (around 300 members) student music organisation. Our aims are:

* to raise the profile of classical music in the university and in the wider community,
* to hold high-quality concerts throughout the year,
* to provide a welcoming and fun environment which can bring out the best in all of our members.

The society is a great way to meet all sorts of people. No matter what your musical background, there is always a place for you within one of the ensembles, allowing you to broaden your musical horizons as well as having a great time along the way.

Whether you are an undergraduate, postgraduate or just someone who has heard about what we do, all you have to do is come along and speak to one of our dedicated committee members. [Find out more about getting involved](/get-involved/).

The society also gets involved with the community, and plays an active role in bringing music to the schools in and around Edinburgh. In recent years interaction between the society and the community has increased a great deal, and there are several annual events that take place involving local primary and secondary schools and a number of our members, guiding them to create music and learn new skills whilst also, of course, having fun.

The Edinburgh University Music Society strives to bring out the best in everyone through the collision of talent and character, and in doing so present the ability of the University to perform excellent music with versatility and brilliance.

### History

The society was founded in 1867 by Sir Herbert Oakeley. Following the ancient University's long musical tradition, which began formally in 1839 when the origins of today's music department were founded as a result of a bequest from General John Reid, the Music Society tied together many casual musical groups that had existed previously.

Throughout the twentieth century the society took part in larger and more extravagant performances, and this tradition has certainly not waned. Recent performances include Elgar's *Dream of Gerontius* and Orff's *Carmina Burana*, and with six major concerts a year the society's repertoire is extensive.

### Conductors

We have three outstanding conductors who have consistently proven themselves capable of bringing the best out of our members, and thanks to them each concert takes the society to new places and brings new delights.

### The committee

The society is run by an elected group of sixteen members known as the committee. These include our office bearers (the President, Secretary and Treasurer), Ensemble Managers and Librarians, Publicity Managers, Social Secretaries, Community Outreach Manager, Tour Manager and our Sponsorship and Alumni Manager. Though the committee lead the organisation of the Society and its events, all members are encouraged to get involved, and many of our additional activities are organised by non-committee members.

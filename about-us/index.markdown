# About us

The music society of the University of Edinburgh was founded in 1867 by Sir
Herbert Oakeley. Following the ancient University's long musical tradition,
which began formally in 1839 when the origins of today's music department were
founded as a result of a bequest from General John Reid, the Music Society tied
together many casual musical groups that had existed previously.

Throughout the twentieth century the Society took part in larger and more
extravagant performances, and this tradition has certainly not waned. Recent
performances include Elgar's *Dream of Gerontius* and Orff's *Carmina Burana*,
and with six major concerts a year the society's repertoire is extensive.

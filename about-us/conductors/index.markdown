<h1 style="text-align: justify;">Our Conductors</h1></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Edinburgh University Music Society, with its three hundred plus members and regular schedule of performances, is no small ensemble. Combining quality of music with a wide repertoire, EUMS requires commitment at all levels. The Society continues to grow in strength, and this is in no small part due to the dedication of our team of conductors.</p></p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>NEIL METCALFE</strong></h2></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Numbering around 200, the EUMS Chorus requires a conductor with a considerable amount of skill and dedication, not to mention a lot of patience. Thankfully, our conductor is more than capable of guiding the talents of the Chorus to bigger and better things year on year.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Neil Metcalfe read music at the University of Edinburgh before taking-up a scholarship in the opera school of the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama, where he trained as a r&eacute;p&eacute;titeur, vocal coach, pianist, continuo player and conductor.&nbsp;He worked for a number of years on the music staff of Scottish Opera, in opera houses in Australia (Sydney), Germany (Dortmund), the United States (Pittsburgh), Northern Ireland (Belfast), and also with many touring companies including Bolshoi Opera, Kirov Opera, Catalan National Theatre, and Deutsche Oper am Rhein.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a performer he has recorded for the BBC (most recently with National Girls' Choir of Scotland) and on the Linn Records label (most recently with Dunedin Consort in JS Bach's <em>Mass in B Minor</em>) and enjoys a busy career as a solo artist, accompanist, MD and conductor. He has appeared in venues as far afield as Greenland and Australia in a wide number of genres from musical theatre to chamber music.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He is also a keen supporter of young people in music; he is chairman of the Scottish Schools Orchestra, a trustee of Edinburgh Young Musicians, and works as an examiner and adjudicator. Neil currently holds the posts of musical director of Edinburgh Grand Opera, Edinburgh Music Theatre Company, Balerno Theatre Company, our very own EUMS Chorus, Edinburgh Studio Opera, the Maltings Theatre and Opening Night Productions. He is also lecturer in Performance Studies at Stevenson College, Edinburgh.</p></p>

<h2><strong>PETER KEENAN</strong></h2><br />
Sinfonia has a long history of being led by exciting, fresh faced new conductors with a knack for bringing out the best in the ensemble and a flask of coffee to get them through Saturday morning rehearsals.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Peter&nbsp;Keenan&nbsp;joined St Mary's Music School in 2005, where his studies included composition with Tom David Wilson, viola with Cathy Marwood and piano with Richard Beauchamp and John Cameron. During this time,&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;was awarded several prizes for composition and piano recitals in both local and national competitions.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2011&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;completed the BA (Hons) music degree at the University of York. During this time&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;began conducting, initially with the Chimera Ensemble (specialising in contemporary music). Highlights included Philip Cashian's Chamber Concerto, Hans Abrahamsen's&nbsp;<i>Lied in Fall</i>&nbsp;and his own father, Paul&nbsp;Keenan's,&nbsp;<i>The Ruin</i>. Other highlights include being Music Director of the University of York Opera Society, with whom he conducted a staged production of Mozart's&nbsp;<i>The Magic Flute</i>.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Peter&nbsp;studies with William Conway and has attended conducting courses with&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;Stark. He intends to further his studies at postgraduate level, with the aim of specialising in the operatic oeuvre of Mozart.&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;also works as a freelance music engraver. He recently contributed to the&nbsp;<i>Giovanni Simon Mayr Werkausgabe</i>&nbsp;(Ricordi) and is currently creating the piano reduction of a new opera by Pelle Gudmundsen-Holmgreen (Edition Wilhelm Hansen), amongst other projects.</p></p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>RUSSELL COWIESON</strong></h2></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Russell Cowieson studied on a McFarlane scholarship at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama (winning the premier performance prize, the &lsquo;Governors Recital prize&rsquo;) and the Guildhall School of Music in London. As a performer he has appeared with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, the RSNO Wind Ensemble, Carol Kidd, Carla Bley and the Stan Tracey Quartet.&nbsp;His conducting studies were undertaken with Timothy Reynish, Baldur Br&ouml;nnimann and George Hurst.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He is currently Musical Director of our very own Symphony Orchestra. His work with EUMS has gained much praise. Our concerts regularly sell out and have seen Symphony Orchestra tackle a wide range of challenging repertoire. Future plans include the commencement of work on an exciting new project which will see them perform James Macmillan&rsquo;s <em>The Confession of Isobel Gowdie</em> in Dundee&rsquo;s Caird Hall, to a specially created choreography for over 200 young dancers.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Deeply committed to education, Russell was the first recipient of the &lsquo;Yamaha Instrumental Teacher of the Year&rsquo; award. In 2007 Russell was appointed Artistic Director of the International Wind Festival held at the RSAMD. Since 2008 he has served regularly on the faculty of the Royal Northern College of Music, Conductor Training Weekend and since 2009 he has been a member of faculty at the internationally renowned Canford Summer School of Music as teacher of conducting. Russell has worked with Young Sinfonia, the RNCM Junior School Orchestra, RSAMD Wind Orchestra, RSAMD Junior School, as a visiting specialist, adjudicator and examiner to the RSAMD, with the Scottish Schools Orchestra Trust, John Currie Singers and Orchestra, Cambridge Holiday Orchestra, Cambridgeshire Youth Wind Orchestra and Dundee Schools Symphony Orchestra.</p></p>

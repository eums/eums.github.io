<h1 style="text-align: justify;">Past Conductors - Soon To Be Updated!<&#47;h1></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Edinburgh University Music Society has had the pleasure of being conducted by a great many well known and talented conductors, alongside supporting many fresh young conductors as they make their way towards greatness. We are privileged&nbsp;to have gained so much support from some of the greatest advocates for music in Scotland and indeed beyond. See a few of them below:<&#47;p></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Below you will find links to the eras of the society, with information (where it can be found) on the conductors of the time. If you know anything new, interesting or unusual about any of our conductors (perhaps some of the ones that we don't mention at all) or indeed about the Society's history in general then please do <a title="Contact Us" href="http:&#47;&#47;eums.eusa.ed.ac.uk&#47;contact&#47;">get in touch<&#47;a>!<&#47;p></p>

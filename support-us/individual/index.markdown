## Individual support

Individual donations, whatever the size, are essential to the Society and
contribute significantly to securing the future of the Edinburgh University
Music Society. Your support will help the Society to sustain its mission and
will ensure that our innovative education and community programme continues to
grow.

Whether you have enjoyed one of our Edinburgh concerts, know someone who has
taken part in an education project run by us or just sat enjoying mulled wine
at one of our various Christmas carolling performances, we hope you will
consider making a donation to the EUMS.

## Corporate support

The Edinburgh University Music Society is Scotland’s foremost student music
organisation with a reputation for outstanding music-making, energy and
innovation. We are proud to have an ever-expanding position within the musical
culture of Scotland, having become the first Scottish university music society
in 1867.

Since 2010, the EUMS brand has expanded to incorporate a widely recognisable
online presence and has become highly successful in broadcasting our aims and
events to a far-ranging audience.

The society performs ten or more times a year, in locations across Edinburgh,
the UK and indeed the world. Our brand is seen by thousands of people
throughout the year, bringing the community into contact with a wide array of
publicity material. Our Spring, Summer and Winter Concert Series are a
well-known feature of the Edinburgh musical calendar.

### What can we offer?

Sponsorship is an exciting, creative way for your business to partner with the
Edinburgh University Music Society in a manner that suits your company’s
mission and objectives.  Sponsorship at various levels offers comprehensive
benefits packages, which include marketing opportunities, society-wide
publicity material branding and unique corporate events.  By supporting EUMS
and its activities, your company can enhance its brand and communicate directly
with local audiences, whilst demonstrating a passion for supporting the local
community.

**Put simply, sponsorship of our society inspires current and potential
customers to invest in your brand.**

Sponsorship of the Edinburgh University Music Society guarantees your company:

* **Increased visibility** and **enhanced brand awareness** through logo
  accreditation on all marketing and publicity material, including a presence
  on our highly-popular website.
* Inclusion in EUMS’s **extensive publicity campaigns**.
* **Brand merchandising opportunities** in the context of the society’s regular
  concerts and tours.
* The opportunity to **affiliate your company** with the oldest student music
  society in Scotland, the quality and dedication in our performance and our
  extensive programme of work in the community.

The Edinburgh University Music Society offers two sponsorship options. This
means that we can tailor our benefits to your input, and allows us to work
together to get the best out of our partnership.

### Financial sponsorship

Our society offers a unique marketing advantage in that we allow exposure to a
very wide demographic. From the children involved in our eduction projects and
the student body that make up the majority of the society through to the range
of ages that attend our concerts: we provide a very effective way to ensure
that your corporate devices are seen by many.

Events we undertake include our **concerts, education projects, international
tours, charity fundraising events** and **social functions**. All of these
offer different opportunities to allow you to align your input with the maximum
marketing output to a target audience suited to your product.

In exchange for meeting some or all of the costs of an event or events you will
be given access to a range of benefits including:

* **Visibility and branding** on programmes, posters, flyers, our website and
  the opportunity to set up an exhibition stall at events.
* **Complimentary tickets** to our concerts, no matter what event you are
  supporting. These are provided with additional benefits such as seat
  reservations and free programmes.
* **Exclusive access** behind-the-scenes with our musicians and organisers.

We can also provide chamber musicians for any corporate events that you hold
within the period of your support, giving you the edge over your competitors.

### In-kind sponsorship

The society often requires equipment, resources and facilities that can be both
costly and difficult to obtain. By providing these at reduced costs you will be
exposing our members and our audiences to your brand, and will also be ensuring
that we can continue to complete [our mission](/about-us/) to the best of our
ability.

Asset sponsors are also entitled to the benefits detailed above and we will
tailor these according to the scale of your input.

## Support us

EUMS is Scotland’s foremost student music body, giving six concerts a year
within Edinburgh alongside an extensive range of additional performing events.
The society also delivers a pioneering education and community programme, and
has worked closely with several local charities.

Every year the society expands its projects and concerts to give its members
and the wider community a better experience, and to align with our society
mission. We are run entirely by students who volunteer time out of their
degrees through a passion for involvement and inclusion in music.

In our 2011/12 season the society spent just under **£40,000** on our events
and projects, and this figure builds year on year.

As we gain more support we are able to expand our horizons further, putting on
bigger and better concerts and reaching further and further into the wider
community. We greatly appreciate support through either [individual donations](/support-us/individual/)
or [corporate sponsorship](/support-us/corporate/).

By supporting EUMS you will be helping the society maintain its high quality
reputation and fulfil its mission to make the finest music available to the
greatest number of people.

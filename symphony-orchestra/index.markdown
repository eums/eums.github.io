## Symphony orchestra

The EUMS Symphony Orchestra is one of the largest and oldest orchestras in
Scotland. It is the society’s only fully auditioned ensemble, rehearsing every
week in term-time from 6.30 to 9.30pm on a Monday evening in the Reid Concert
Hall, Bristo Square.

Conducted by the [ever passionate Russell Cowieson](/conductors/#russell-cowieson),
the orchestra aims to provide students with the opportunity to play large-scale
orchestral works to a very high standard. Concerts are given at the end of each
semester in various locations around Edinburgh, including Greyfriars Kirk and
St Mary’s Cathedral.  Recent works have included Tchaikovsky’s Sixth Symphony,
Rimsky Korzakov’s Scheherazade and Respighi’s Pines of Rome. Feel free to have
a listen to [an excerpt from a concert recording of Shostakovich’s Tenth Symphony](http://www.last.fm/music/Edinburgh+University+Music+Society/EUMS+Symphony+Orchestra:+Spring+Concert+2011/Shostakovich:+Symphony+No.+10,+II.+Allegro).

Every two years the orchestra teams up with the EUMS Chorus to perform large
scale orchestral and choral works in one of its concerts. Recently performed
pieces include Orff's *Carmina Burana* and Verdi's *Requiem* with soloists from
within the music society as well as professional singers. Last year Symphony
Orchestra teamed up with the Chorus to perform *The Dream of Gerontius* by
Elgar.

As a group of musicians, Symphony Orchestra has a diverse membership and an
impressive track record in engaging with our wider community. In 2012 alone the
orchestra comprised players from 16 different countries including the Czech
Republic, France, the Netherlands, Latvia, Spain, the USA, Hong Kong, Germany
and Sweden, and through both our [extensive education projects](/community/education)
and outreach programmes commits itself to helping communicate the benefits and
delights of classical music for everyone. In 2013 this has included a grand
rendition of MacMillan’s The Confession of Isobel Gowdie with over 200 children
in Dundee’s Caird Hall as part of a specially commissioned youth dance
performance.

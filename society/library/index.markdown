<h1 style="text-align: left;">Music Library<&#47;h1><br />
<img alt="" src="http:&#47;&#47;eums.eusa.ed.ac.uk&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;images&#47;w620&#47;library.jpg" width="620" height="250" &#47;></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Since our founding in 1867, we have collected a wide range of choral and instrumental music, including pieces written specifically for us by various composers. In 2012 EUMS transferred a large quantity of its collection to a number of other musical organisations on long-term loan; however, we still retain a large library of pieces, some unique.<&#47;p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Hiring music from our library costs a nominal rate of &pound;10&#47;month per set in addition to postage, with the cost being invoiced at the end of the agreed hire period.<&#47;p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As part of our aim to increase the ease of provision to younger musicians, <em>student and youth music groups will not incur these hire costs<&#47;em> and would only pay for the postage of music.<&#47;p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><big>The full catalogue can be found <a title="Our music catalogue" href="http:&#47;&#47;eums.eusa.ed.ac.uk&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;files&#47;catalogue.pdf">by following this link<&#47;a>.<&#47;big><&#47;strong><&#47;p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For further details of the music we have on offer, and to make enquiries with regards to the hire of a set of music, please contact our President at <a title="Email us" href="mailto:president@eums.org.uk" target="_blank">president@eums.org.uk<&#47;a>.<&#47;p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><small>The Edinburgh University Music Society and its committee retains the right to charge appropriate and necessary penalty fees for the damage or loss of any hired music.<&#47;small><&#47;p></p>

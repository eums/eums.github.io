<h1 style="text-align: justify;">EUMS Symphony Orchestra<&#47;h1><br />
<img class="size-full wp-image-620" alt="" src="http:&#47;&#47;eums.eusa.ed.ac.uk&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;images&#47;w620&#47;symph3.jpg" width="620" height="250" &#47;></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><big>The EUMS Symphony Orchestra is one of the largest and oldest orchestras in Scotland. It is the society's only fully auditioned ensemble, rehearsing every week in term-time from 6.30 to 9.30pm on a Monday evening in the <a title="Rehearsing" href="http:&#47;&#47;eums.eusa.ed.ac.uk&#47;find&#47;practice&#47;">Reid Concert Hall, Bristo Square<&#47;a>.<&#47;big><&#47;strong><&#47;p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Conducted by <a title="Conductors" href="http:&#47;&#47;eums.eusa.ed.ac.uk&#47;society&#47;conductors&#47;">the ever passionate Russell Cowieson<&#47;a>, the orchestra aims to provide students with the opportunity to play large-scale orchestral works to a very high standard. Concerts are given at the end of each semester in various locations around Edinburgh, including Greyfriars Kirk and St Mary's Cathedral. Recent works have included&nbsp;Tchaikovsky's<em>&nbsp;Sixth Symphony<&#47;em>,&nbsp;Rimsky Korzakov's<em> Scheherazade<&#47;em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;Respighi's<em> Pines of Rome<&#47;em>. Feel free to have a listen to&nbsp;an&nbsp;excerpt&nbsp;from a concert recording of Shostakovich's <em>Tenth Symphony<&#47;em>:<&#47;p></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Every two years the orchestra teams up with the <a title="Chorus" href="http:&#47;&#47;eums.eusa.ed.ac.uk&#47;society&#47;biography&#47;chorus&#47;">EUMS Chorus<&#47;a> to perform large scale orchestral and choral works in one of its concerts. Recently performed pieces include Orff's<em> Carmina Burana and<&#47;em>&nbsp;Verdi's <em>Requiem<&#47;em> with soloists from within the music society as well as professional singers. Last year Symphony Orchestra teamed up with the Chorus to perform&nbsp;<em>The Dream of Gerontius<&#47;em> by Elgar<em>.&nbsp;<&#47;em><&#47;p></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As a group of musicians, Symphony Orchestra has a diverse membership and an impressive track record in engaging with our wider community. In 2012 alone the orchestra comprised players from 16 different countries including the&nbsp;Czech Republic,&nbsp;France,&nbsp;the Netherlands, Latvia, Spain, the USA, Hong Kong, Germany and Sweden, and through both our <a title="Education Projects" href="http:&#47;&#47;eums.eusa.ed.ac.uk&#47;community&#47;education&#47;springproject&#47;">extensive education projects<&#47;a> and outreach programmes commits itself to helping communicate the benefits and delights of classical music for everyone. In 2013 this has included a grand rendition of MacMillan's <em>The Confession of Isobel Gowdie<&#47;em> with over 200 children in Dundee's Caird Hall as part of a specially commissioned youth dance performance.<&#47;p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Auditions for all instruments take place during Fresher's Week and can be signed up for during the Fresher's Fair. The audition involves playing a piece of music selected by yourself and also a short bit of sight-reading in front of a small panel including our conductor.<&#47;p></p>

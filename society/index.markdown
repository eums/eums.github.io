# The Society

<img alt="" src="http://eums.eusa.ed.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/build/society.jpg">

The Edinburgh University Music Society is widely regarded as one of Scotland&rsquo;s leading student music organisations, not only in its standard of performance but also in its involvement within the wider community through education projects and fundraising concerts.

The music society of the University of Edinburgh was founded in 1867 by Sir Herbert Oakeley. Following the ancient University&rsquo;s long musical tradition, which began formally in 1839 when the origins of today&rsquo;s music department were founded as a result of a bequest from General John Reid, the Music Society tied together many casual musical groups that had existed previously.

Throughout the twentieth century the Society took part in larger and more extravagant performances, and this tradition has certainly not waned. Recent performances include Elgar&rsquo;s <em>Dream of Gerontius</em> and Orff&rsquo;s <em>Carmina Burana</em>, and with six major concerts a year the society's repertoire is extensive.
